        "text": "\"First and foremost, we as Chicago Public School students would like to thank you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to improve our Chicago... All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility away from artists, but it hasn't changed you... We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you. Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be successful, still be self-made... Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we know and love, Chicago. Sincerely, Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt Lake View High School Students Chicago, Illinois\" It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back. It should work. As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love. That's cool that this love goes back and forth! We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #chancetherapper #chicago #music #hiphop #rap"

Perez moved to Chicago when he was 8-years- old and was a permanent legal resident. He joined the U.S. Army and served two tours of duty in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury in an explosion. Perez served seven years; but because he is not a U.S. citizen, Immigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and began the deportation process. This system doesn't appreciate our sacrifices. America was designed that way it will only benefit gringos. Miguel Perez is a real hero, who was betrayed by America. When will we have real justice in this country?"

Steve King said that \"The United States is moving towards becoming, the whites becoming a minority, a majority- minority within the country.\" Also, he said that \"Blacks and Hispanics will be fighting each other before overtaking whites in population\", and this is exactly what authorities want. They will be ruling us while we would be too busy fighting each other! So, don't let this happen! Help black people in their struggle and let them help us!"

It wasn't easy to follow the dream for Ebony. Or it's better to say that there were some hardships \u2014 for example, Ebony was growing without a father etc, but despite these things she successfully got the proper education and became the first black female anesthesiologist in 2013. Hilton says she never had plan B. Now she is mentoring youth as a member of program called Girls Loving OurSelves Successfully (GLOSS). That's sweet. Black women always show the power in any conditions. That's inspiring! And it's especially good that Hilton dedicated herself to teaching others. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #ebonyhilton #blackgirlmagic"

People should know the origins, not to confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird. White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise. Same goes to African Americans who copy white people. Know yourself!

We made the first cattle drive, started the first ranches, we were the first ranchers, miners, mountain men, cowboys etc. in what is now the U.S. Everything changed when white colonists came. Europe was rejecting the worst people so those; who were arriving at our lands were killers, rapists; murderers, thieves and other scum. So, why are their descendants worried about immigrants? They forgot that what goes around comes around!"

She says: \"Diversity on the bench is so important because the people that come to court come from all different walks of life, different ethnic backgrounds, different religious backgrounds.\" However, if it's a sign of diversity, this is a very weak sign. Just think, we are indigenous inhabitants of this land and we were cut off all privileges since gabachos came and stole our land. So, it took almost 500 years for our woman to reach a prestigious position in the government that is not really caring about us! Whether there are latinos or not, authorities will continue to deport us from our indigenous land!"

This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the woman tell Lim, \"Check my bag. I'm telling you I don't have anything.\" And why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what? Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg chapter of the NAACP demanded that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, I want it be not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black people were treated disrespectfully! We don't believe apologies, especially when we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose! Williams&Kalvin www.youtube.com"
