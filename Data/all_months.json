        "text": "NOT EVERY BOY WANTS TO BE A SOLDIER. A beautiful message was seen on the streets of the capitol,. with no group name or credits attached to the project. It was the poster at top, of the bearded man in a pink gown behaving like a queen and holding a sign saying \"Not every boy wants to be a soldier\". A timely message for today. The two recent U.S. wars were costly for our nation; to put it lightly. They led to domestic devastation of country. No matter what Defense Secretary or POTUS are saying they don't fool me with promises of gay military equality as key to the nation's agenda. Better talk to me about cutting DoD's budget. FOLKS. #Igbt #USarmy #CrossDress #GaySoldier #Obama #DefenseBudget #StopWar"

        "text": "Republican strategist Karl Rove said on \"Fox News Sunday\" the only way to stop gun-related violence, like the Wednesday massacre at Emmanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston S.C., was to repeal American citizens' Second Amendment rights. It's strange to hear it from the man who supported 2nd amendment earlier. The lack of clear-cut opinion is very bad character trait. However, it doesn't matter. The right to bear arms is inalienable right of Americans that was given us by the Founding Fathers. The 2nd amendment guarantees private safety of the people. The right to keep and bear arms has been recognized as existing prior even to the creation of a written national constitution. The govermmnet should respect the 2nd amendment and the law in general. It's pity when some politicians think otherwise. People should understand that a gun is not a killing tool, it's self-defense tool. And we will stand for our right to keep and bear arms!"

        "text": "The Chinese hackers executed a complex attack that gave them \"administrator privileges\" into the computer networks at the Office of Personnel Management, mimicking the credentials of people who run the agency's systems. They began siphoning out a rush of data after constructing what amounted to an electronic pipeline that led back to China, investigators told Congress last week in classified briefings. Much of the personnel data had been stored in the lightly protected systems of the Department of the Interior, because it had cheap, available space for digital data storage. The administration is urgently working to determine what other agencies are storing similarly sensitive information with weak protections. Officials would not identify their top concerns, but an audit issued early last year, before the Chinese attacks, harshly criticized lax security at the Internal Revenue Service, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Energy Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and the Department of Homeland Security, which has responsibility for securing the nation's critical networks. It's not clear who is held liable for security hole. What do you think the hacker attack will affect U.S. \u2014 Chinese relations?"

With the introduction of the American Professional Football Association, later renamed to the National Football League, audiences saw athletes play more ferociously than ever before. American football has actually became national kind of sports in the United States. We are proud of such players as Michael Vick, Peyton Manning and John Elway. We are proud we live in America!"

South Carolina governor calls for removal of Confederate flag from statehouseGovernor Nikki Haley makes abrupt about-face in wake of Charleston killings to call for removal of flag that has flown on statehouse grounds for 50 years The Confederate flag represents heritage, not hate. The war that is called the \"Civil War\" was actually the \"War for Southern Independence\". This is our history and our heritage. Just because certain groups have used the confederate flag in hate related crimes or racism does not make the southern flag racist. Now it is used to show heritage and pride from the south showing that they have been strong and have overcome what has happened to them over time."

Why should we give a citizenship to those who cannot give something good for the nation? The worst thing is that illegal immigrants who broke the law to live in the United States demand ask for indulgences. What nonsense! Illegals should be deported from the country invariably. But Obama's administration is tied to the chariot of immigrants. Democrats know that immigrants will vote for the Democratic party. Especially former illegals. That's why Barack Obama tries to give the Immigration Amnesty to illegals as soon as possible. It will allow to increase a number of votes for a Democratic Party presidential candidate in 2016. And democrats don't care about the fact that most of immigrants will become welfare recipients, increasing unemployment rate. America doesn't need immigrants, democrats do. What's more important: to win Presidential elections in 2016 or to make America better? Democrats seem to choose first option. That's what differs republicans from democrats."

        "text": "NOM'S LAST ATTEMPT TO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let's take a look at just how crazy this pledge gets. That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55 percent! But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to \"work to overturn any Supreme Court decision\" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge. Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws, creating loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious justification. That could actually happen \u2014 and it already has in some states \u2014 so it's a huge concern. And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated from their families, but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it! There's a part of me that feels very sad for NOM's fanatics. When they finally kick the bucket, they'll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly face it or not) that their Life's Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they worked for made anyone's life better. At all. They didn't win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable. And when they're dead and gone, they'll be remembered only as footnotes in shameful history \u2014 or more likely they'll be forgotten completely. #LGBT #NOM #SameSexMarriage #Marriage #SCOTUS #equality"

But now that she's a star in 'Orange is the New Black', the popularity of this model, actress, and VJ has grown worldwide. \"Gender fluidity is not really feeling like you're at one end of the spectrum or the other. For the most part, I definitely don't identify as any gender,\" - Rose said; - \"I'm not a guy; I don't really feel like a woman, but obviously I was born one. As a little kid, I was convinced that I was a guy. Then in my teens, I tried to be quite feminine. .. And after a little bit, chopped everything off and am kind of back where I started. So, I'm somewhere in the middle, which - in my perfect imagination - is like having the best of both sexes.\" #Igbt #RubyRose #GenderFluidity #lesbian #OrangelsTheNewBlack"

She is the ninth confirmed transgender homicide victim in the USA this year. Police in George County. Mississippi have charged a suspect Josh Brandon Vallum. Police said that Mercedes and Josh knew each other, but it is not clear if Vallum knew Williamson was a transgender. Jeanie Miller, whom Williamson had been living with, said that Vallum knew that Williamson was transgender. Modern America is too dangerous for transgenders. This is the ninth transgender killing based on gender identity. According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs' report hate-motivated violence against transgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a transgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in 1998 that allows discrimination against LGBT people. That also allows lawmakers to justify hostility toward transgender people. And that we call `freedom'? America is no longer land of freedom!"

'I spent the majority of my life lying, hiding and depressed because I felt like I couldn't truly be who I wanted to be and live freely as I saw fit. I had to act and that's not me. I, nor anyone else, should have to do that.' Matt decided to tell the truth publicly because of speculation that was going behind his back.

Schlax has been working with Cleve Jones, a human rights activist, who was mentored by Harvey Milk. It is proposed that the class will begin in autumn. Really perfect idea! There are at least twenty eight percent of LGBT students in Asawa High School. It is the fact that we need such classes in every American school! Children shouldn't be afraid to show who they are; they shouldn't be afraid to speak about LGBT history; they should know that it is normal to be gay or lesbian or transgender. Everybody should be taught to understand LGBT people and recognize them as ordinary citizens."

California Attorney General Kamala Harris claimed that the proposal was unconstitutional and it had no place in civil society. The proposal reminds me the Inquisition. We live in a free and tolerate country! So even talks about such an initiative should be immediately stopped. Where is our President? Stop considering gays as naughty and not like all the others.

The Boy Scouts of America Executive Committee unanimously approved allowing gay adults to serve as leaders, officials said on Monday, in a major step toward dismantling a policy that has caused deep rifts in the 105-year-old organization. This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders without regard to sexual orientation, continuing Scouting's longstanding policy of chartered organizations selecting their leaders. The Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay adults has stood as a towering example of explicit, institutional homophobia in one of America's most important and recognizable civic organizations. This is a step in the right direction, but we're still really concerned that there are still going to be groups that are going to be hostile to gay leaders ... This story certainly brought out the haters and the loony \"Christians.\" They've lost so many cultural battles in their effort to keep us all in the middle ages that I think it's unhinged most of them!"

Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary among his fellow Army soldiers. But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first openly trans soldier of the US Army. He's astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (check out his muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee, he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska. Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army paperwork, he is identified as a woman. But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded! America's military progressing slowly towards inclusion and equal opportunity. Let's hope that these changes'll ensure peace, instead of waging more war. #Igbt #transgender #equality #usarmy #Ortega"

After eight years on the job, Margie Winters was fired as director of religious education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she just married her wife, but because some parents just found out that she's been married for all eight years. Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is the biggest mistake! When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about being gay. And it's a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and harassment. Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It's very powerful both for straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs. It's important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation!"

We are just people, not criminals! AND WE LOVE CHILDREN, NOT RAPE!! We are all equal! It is better for child to live with homosexual parents then to live on the street or in orphanage! Millions of children need love and they don't care if our love is different. Why should we let those children that are left on the streets be on the streets when a warm and open home are open to them?! I don't understand!!"

Just wanted to see if you could share my coming out as trans story on your page. I have been on a long, rough journey to this point and I think my story could help younger trans youth see that no matter how bad it gets it always gets better. I would really appreciate this because I want to become someone who inspires the LGBT community to be themselves! Ever since I was little, I knew I was different. I wasn't like any of the other kids. I had a unique way of thinking and often that left me isolated. Something I still feel the sting of today. Unlike most boys who played with Spiderman and Superman action figures when they were little, I played with barbies ... I wanted to look like them. I wanted to be them. It felt right playing with these dolls. I had to hide when I did it though because even at an early age, I knew boys weren't supposed to play with dolls. Once I had gotten got caught by my grandmother's ex husband and he told me to put them away and stop being a sissy .... \" Please spend 5 minutes to read this letter ... it is very important just to be heart ... Thank you for your brave act! You are a true hero! Please share your stories and photos .... Inspire us and others!"

        "text": "Made In The US: The Justice Turns Into Business For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor charges in New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'cause they couldn't afford to pay bail. Under the city's new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department, the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or disorderly conduct. The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what should we do? The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse, it is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a business. The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government will start to sell indulgences soon. Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail! Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other Presidents administrations were brought to justice. America has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a means to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping the very rich from ever being brought to justice."

He declared his shop a \"Muslim-free zone\" in response to a shooting in Chattanooga, where a Kuwait-born terrorist killed five US Marines. Hallinan announced his store's new policy sitting against the Confederate flag. The video posted in Facebook became popular. What we can say? Hallinan is completely right! If the government cannot provide our security, then we must do everything possible to provide it. A lot of Muslims become Islamists, who pose a real threat to our national security. We consider that it is really dangerous to sell arms to Muslims, as there're a lot of terrorists among them. The 2nd amendment was written for people, but it doesn't relieve people of responsibility."

The U.S. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida (21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421). Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps new terrorist attacks won't be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won't be tightened. We have a lot of problems that require an active response and decisions from the government: poverty, the problems of veterans, homelessness, racism, law enforcement system and so on. Is it possible to offer a better life for refugees if not all US citizens live normally?"

        "text": "The Census Bureau published the new data in its International Data Base, which contains population estimates and projections up to the year 2050. The figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration\u2014meaning the total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would actually be larger than 1.24 million. Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the U.S. economy. Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions increases crime rates. Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a report of the Center for Immigration Studies. You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen the U.S. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can't be the Tower of Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We don't hate foreigners, we are glad to see tourists from every corner of the world, but we cannot allow them to stay here. It's the bathos of stupidity to stimulate immigration when it creates enormous problems for the nation."

This statement sounds strange on the background of rapproachment between Obama's administration and Tehran. Although, this rapproachment in itself looks strange. We would remind you that Tehran has never expressed its condolences for the Iran hostage crisis. Moreover, the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Hosseini Khamenei is too disrespectful to the United States despite of friendly actions of Obama's administration. And Iranian military command claims that Iran is ready to come into collision with America at any moment. The Iran deal is a shame of the United States. Senate Republicans were right when they expressed their distrust of Iranian government. It's not clear why Obama has refused containment of Iran that is an potential enemy not only for the United States, but also for the rest world. Barack Obama is, by all appearances, a true traitor of the United States. And it's not empty words \u2014 the rapprochement with Iran is either a treachery or stupidness."

The USA is out of balance now. We loose our history! The gays, lesbians and trans-sexuals have more rights now then other folks. They bring pervert culture in our houses as something normal. Today, LGBT community has turned into the head and everyone else is the tail. We inherit the history, we make it, and we are fated to become part of it. What kind of inheritage next generation will get? The rainbow flag that is offensive and a symbol of hate. Instead of delete a big part of our history, can we ban the rainbow from public display?"

Authorities say a man was a practicing Muslim. At present FBI is conducting an investigation. According to his beliefs, Mohammad was a fundamental Islamist. Having examined after his death his social pages, FBI has found that he kept a blog and had a note where he said that he conducted a terrorist act in obedience to Allah. It is notable that the terrorist attack was conducted in the last day of Ramadan. It is noteworthy that in his letter the terrorist didn't refer to ISIS or AI-Qaeda; he acted in his own volition. We don't want to stir up Islamophobia, but if such manifestations of Islam have place, it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the Middle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to become radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on their own commit such attacks, the American society must take it more seriously. The society should develop a new behavioral model towards Islam, according to which, on the one hand Muslims and Christians will live comfortable together. And on the other hand, Muslims won't tend to radical activities and the destruction of peaceful life of Americans."

        "text": "The spread of hatred in the American society On Saturday there were two protests: a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina and an anti-racism protest. About 2,000 people arrived to South Carolina's statehouse. Some of them present the KKK's rally against the removal of the Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and Black Lives matter groups, holding the Republic of New Afrika flag. It is a very clear signal for the federal government that the protest obtains a systematic and ideological basis. The Klan wanted to underline the traditional heritage of the Confederate flag. Black protesters, on the contrary stand against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races. The main problem is hatred which is spread among our society. The government does nothing to solve the matter. If America is a land of free, we should clear our country of racism. But on the other hand we shouldn't refuse our history and our traditions."

President Obama hasn't ordered to lower a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or her state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By contrast, Obama ordered the flags to half-staff following on the same day that as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered to half-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon, the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of Nelson Mandela. But it hasn't yet been lowered in honor of the service members murdered in Tennessee. By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then decided to kill in the name of Allah. In general during the Obama presidency the country was divided in many ways: racism became more evident, the number of illegal immigrants, who do not even bother to learn English, because it's enough to speak Spanish, has increased."

        "text": "Remember when African Americans couldn't drink from the same drinking fountains as whites? Remember when gay people couldn't get married? Both scenarios sound so ridiculous. Especially when you think about how much money is to be gained if same-sex couples are legally allowed to get married. A majority of small business owners believe companies shouldn't be allowed to withhold goods or services from lesbian, gay,bisexual or transgender people based on an owner's religious beliefs, according to a survey released Monday. Of course marriage is good for the business - no matter who it is that is marrying. It's a billion dollar industry in our country! I am certain that if a state supported marriage for all, then business would flourish. No one would be offended by not being considered legitimate, when their feelings are legitimate."

        "text": "'THAT'S NOT WHAT I AM': TRANSGENDER PERSON FIGHTS TO CHANGE 'F' TO 'M' ON DRIVER'S LICENSE. One of the friends of our group shared his story with us! He has been discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky. There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to change the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery. But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats. It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\\her identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they were assigned to at birth. Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible. Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you were assigned to at birth. Please share your stories with us, because united we can stand against injustice and inequality! #Kentucky #transgender #inequality #discrimination"

        "text": "HOMOPHOBIA STILL RUNNING STRONG IN AMERICA. Controversial artist Ed Freeman sparked fury among conservative patriots after sharing his own version of the 1945 image. The outrage was caused by artist's artwork recreating iconic Iwo Jima photo. with a gay pride flag and half-naked men has received death threats. That's a bit too harsh treatment for an artist, don't you think? What's this; the American version of Je suis Charlie? Joe Rosenthal's picture of soldiers hauling a flag pole up after declaring the island of Iwo Jima secure during the Second World War won the Pulitzer Prize in 1945. Around 70.000 U.S. troops fought more than 20,000 Japanese. It wasn't a fair fight back then, and it's not a fair fight today. But there's nothing disrespectful in this image. Isn't the imitation is the best form of homage? #homophobia #JoeRosenthal #EdFreeman #IwoJlma"

        "text": "We have a method in place called, don't vote these morons into office! Passing the \"First Amendment Defense Act\" introduced by Sen. Mike Lee has been anti-LGBT conservatives' top priority since the Supreme Court brought marriage equality to all 50 states. It's part of the National Organization for Marriage's post-Obergefell plan and Republican presidential candidate pledge, and the Family Research Council mentions it almost daily. Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does is enable anti-gay discrimination. Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against religious institutions \u2014for discriminating against people in same-sex marriages. It's the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex couple's marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them. Mr. Lee, you are ridiculous! You're just going to have to get over that fact that we have full Federal civil rights now. Or don't! We will go on happily living our lives while you froth at the mouth and throw a fit because we're being treated equally under the law!"

        "text": "PLEASE NO HATE! JUST LET US EAT CAKE! Wedding cake is back in the news with developments in both the Oregon and Colorado bakery cases involving discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In Oregon, judgment has been finalized against Sweet Cakes by Melissa, requiring Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay a $135,000 fine for refusing service to a same-sex couple. Meanwhile, in Colorado, Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop, is appealing the ruling against him for refusing to serve a same-sex couple. In the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, conservatives are eager to highlight Phillips and the Kleins as evidence that religious freedom is under attack. In fact, they have actually invented a new claim about how these bakers' \"free speech\" is under attack and how they're thus the real victims. There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do business with the public! This is not a free speech issue, it is an issue of American law! They can speak about their bigotry and ignorance, not to practice it!"

The popular show is based on a young boy named Steven, who grows up with three magical aliens \u2014 the 'Crystal Gems' Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl. The show, which has already won praise for including a number of strong, female characters in a comparatively male-dominated genre, has now hinted at further diversity. That's s000 nice!

For decades, conservative Christians who oppose LGBT equality have singled out the federal government or secular atheists as their preferred enemy in public settings, blasting both groups for supposedly attacking \"traditional marriage\" or infringing on their religious liberty. Yet in the months surrounding the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to legalize same-sex marriage across the country, right-wing Christians have become increasingly willing to cast blame \u2014 seemingly hypocritically \u2014 on a group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians, especially those who support marriage equality. I believe religions should teach love, they must stop teaching hatred!

It was her first public appearance since announcing her decision to transition. And her speech brought me to tears. It was very touching and thought provoking. She spoke about her own personal experience so far as a transgender woman. But she also dedicated a significant percentage of her speech to a thoughtful and touching discussion of the vast number of issues facing the larger transgender community. In her past life Caitlyn was known worldwide as a sports hero. Today she is an American hero of a great courage. Because it takes courage to stand up and do everything she has done and is doing. #CaitlynJenner #transgender #equality #ESPY"

Meet professional soccer players Erin McLeod and Ella Masar, who play for Houston Dash in the National Women's Soccer League.

While it's only been a few months, they're ready to take the next step. Miley's told friends that Stella is the one. And she wants to make a huge statement with an over-the-top wedding in the fall! She can't stop talking about how in love she is and how she wants the whole world to know... Miley came out as bisexual recently, not all of her relationships have been \"straight, heterosexual\" ones. She also told Paper magazine how she came out to her mom when she was 14, saying, \"I remember telling her I admire women in a different way. And she asked me what that meant. And I said, 'I love them. I love them like I love boys.\"' We hope Miley can move on from the wrecking balls and think about wedding bells once she's ready!"

        "text": "Controversy surrounding the flag only heats animosity among Americans. And it is becoming dangerous. So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family. \"He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn't worth anything now,\" Mark Wilson said. When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it's amoral, it is beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don't want to understand that slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a flag of England or France. Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political correctness because George Washington owned slaves. Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not clear. If somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to eliminate the party. Continue to stay for the First amendment! Let's stop the chaos!"

The kids that need foster care come from heterosexual families. So I think the straights should be banned from being foster parents! A Kansas Department of Children and Families official said that the state will continue to allow qualified single adults to serve as foster parents for abused and neglected children, but she said her agency isn't ready to say whether it will allow married same-sex couples to do so. Oh God ... Just because your gay doesn't make you any less of a human or any less deserving of any right afforded to anyone else! Anyone who believes that a gay person is below a straight person needs treatment! It is time for this freaking discrimination to end! They have no valid reasons for denying married gays from adopting and fostering kids. All they are doing is denying kids loving homes because of their own bigotry."

        "text": "Most parents aren't prepared for the words, \"Mom, Dad. I'm gay.\" For many parents first reaction probably will be \"How will I ever handle this?\" The answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your continued relationship with your son or daughter. Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during that time. Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're hearing (\"It's just a phase; you'll get over it\"); by shutting down (\"If you choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it\"); or by not registering the impact of what we're being told (\"That's nice, dear, and what do you want for dinner?\"). Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person. It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through \"a phase\". On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, \"Is she/he sure?\" the answer will almost always be \"yes\"! DON'T BE YOUR CHILD'S FIRST CLOSET! #children #lgbt #momdadimgay #gayisok #comingout #acceptance"

A copy of the alert said that the wife of a U.S. military member was approached in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May. Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June. We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the U.S. military has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don't fully perform their duties. First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to identify people who scour after the wives and children of the U.S. Military. Secondly, families of the U.S. Military should be taken under special protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the U.S. Military family members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn't worth a dime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a negative scenario there won't be any need in their work. And this will be the final nail in the coffin of the American secret services. Let's remember the last FBI and NSA failures, such as failure to stop the Boston Marathon Bombings and so on. Our soldiers fight for America at the other end of the world and they deserve that their families should be kept safe."

The government spent more than $120 billion on the conflict in Vietnam from 1965-73 that led to the widespread inflation. Psychological effects were even deeper. The war had pierced the myth of American invincibility, and had bitterly divided the nation. Many returning veterans faced negative reactions from both opponents of the war and its supporters. In 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was created in Washington, D.C. There the names of 57,939 American armed forces killed or missing during the war are inscribes. Latter the total additions brought to 58,267."

Almost half of students are served in our program for English as a second language, so it will take years before some students master the language. Immigrants use every excuse why they can't learn: poverty, racism, too much homework, the list is endless. The main question is why do American taxpayers should pay and take responsibility to provide translators for folks who don't make an effort to learn and speak English? This is unfair that those kids whose parents chose to immigrate here (most illegally) are all on welfare. They know they don't have to work, because the government will take care of them. So, if the government continues to keep the same standards for illegal immigrants, America will become another 3rd world country."

Well, this story clearly demonstrates what value for the state the life of a man willing to sacrifice means. In fact the government doesn't care about its soldiers, even if they are heroes. This confirms that the government's slapdash attitude to the recording vets system left more than 35,000 veterans without medical assistance. And how many of them died before the error in the database was revealed! A truly disgusting attitude to our soldiers!"

I bet you remember the white former officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, last August? After national debate over the relationship between police and black communities Darren Wilson aka \"Bad cop, who killed innocent black child\" tried to go back to police work but was turned down because he's too big a liability. In the recent interview to New Yorker magazine he said, \"It's too hot an issue, so it makes me unemployable.\" So what does the situation mean to America? Almost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had the audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent. Michael Brown was a thug, who had just assaulted a store owner, and robbed him. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He must stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how upside-down society has become. I wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will surgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send teachers to jail for teaching? Instead hate Wilson, we should pray for him. He did nothing wrong but idiots turned society against an innocent man. So is it a new America?"

The ruling was premised chiefly on the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of a number of protected categories, including sexual orientation. I'm so sick of this true Christians who have never taken the Bible in their hands. reading or listening someone who read ancient texts and then declaring them to be applicable to today violates the scriptures. God didn't support divorces, so why did bakers not refuse service to divorcees? Anyway, the truth on our side... finally. So, grab your bae and go to eat some cakes!"

Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of Amber's family and friends whom she clearly loved deeply. Trans woman murdered in Detroit. According to initial police reports, 20-year- old Amber Monroe was shot to death. A lot of transgendered women don't have support systems or employment. So they are forced to do whatever they can do to survive. This attack was fueled by transphobia and we do know that Amber's murder is the 12th murder of a transgender woman in the United States this year, and the 10th murder of a transgender woman of color. Transgender women, and especially transgender women of color, are disproportionately affected by violence. Her life was just beginning... I know that this loss will leave so many people with a hole in their lives and with more questions than answers. Let's work for real change so that our transgender sisters can be free from persecution. I know we can do better. We have to do better!"

It looks like military prosecutors view Manning in a way that means she must be \"broken\" or forcefully assimilated because of her crime \u2014first, because she exposed the government's crimes, and government really doesn't like it, and second, because she's trans. Their goal is to see that Manning is as dehumanized as possible, but it's clear who the real non-humans are. Someone has gone to great lengths to paint Chelsea as a deceitful and psychotic character. But how many of those punishing Manning should themselves be in a psych ward? Transphobia is a one ugly thing. So sad when heroes like Chelsea Manning forced to suffer, to undergo injustice and humiliation, even though they had been through enough already!

And of course this world always need an amazing power of woman's touch:-) Isn't it just amazing? Wonder Woman presides over the wedding of two brides in Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman, Chapter 48 written and illustrated by Jason Badower. Badower said he also really wanted to reference current affairs in the story - specifically, legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide. \"I saw this Wonder Woman story as an incredible opportunity to have one of the most recognizable, iconic characters in the world to be among the first to step forward and officially endorse this new law,\" he said. \"I thought, let's not just have Wonder Woman embrace this new law, let's have her celebrate it.\" Some may ask \u2014 why is it so important when superheroes depicted as supporters of marriage equality? Because it is a massive, land-mark milestone in LBGTQ rights history. Because the fight to get to normal was so difficult, and because the fight to change normal is still ongoing. Just like Wonder Woman using her superpowers to struggle with violence and injustice of the world! :-) #wonderwoman #superheroes #marriageequality #gaymarriage #lesbian"

The ceremony will mark the official reopening of the U.S. embassy along Havana's oceanfront promenade that overlooks the Florida Straits. `My inspiration is thinking about 90 miles separating the two countries and the two people, 90 miles is the sea between us.' Just 90 miles, but at the same time it is a vast schism that separates the United States from Cuba. The poet added he hopes there's still possible to achieve \"healing\" between the two countries. `This very moment, the negotiation of cultural identities... This just seems so surreal still... This is really in some sense just the beginning, the dawn of new things to come.' It would be so great if it will be indeed a new hope and a new day for Cuba, country which is still struggling to recover from severe embargo, country abused by wars. Sadly, the United States participated and initiated many of these conflicts... And there's more - severe economic crisis, socialist dictatorship of Cuban leaders. It's time for us to lend a helping hand. #RichardBlanco #Cuba #ForeignRelations #gay #queerart"

A Kentucky clerk who defied a federal judge's order to issue marriage licenses and turned away four gay couples has until Monday to convince the judge to delay his mandate. U.S. District Judge David L. Bunning rejected Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis' claim that her Christian faith should exempt her from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples and ordered her on Wednesday to hand out the licenses. But her office kept denying them. Interesting what would happen if I walked up to my boss and said I refuse to the job I am being paid for today? Let me think... guess I would stand in the unemployment line! Her job is not to participate in gay weddings!! All she has to do is confirm that the paperwork is correct! She should be fired, fined and charged with contempt of court!"

The 63-year-old comedian, who had struggled with depression, died by suicide on August 11 2014. His widow Susan Schneider said at the time of his death: \"As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.\" Even at home, Williams exhibited acceptance for the LGBT community with his trademark playfulness. While he denied rumours about being gay, he had no qualms about discussing the sexuality of his pet pug. He said: \"I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We're very modern.\" When the Westboro Baptist announced its intentions to picket his funeral, pro- LGBT organisation Planting Peace raised over $40,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital \u2014one of Williams' favourite charities. Robin Williams played many different roles in so many people's lives, and giving back to others was at the top of that list... We will never forget you. And we'll always love you..."

Coming out as transgender requires telling everyone in your life about you and enduring the consequences which often means the loss of family, lifelong friends, your job, and being the subject of ridicule, discrimination, and often violence.

Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to choose whether to issue marriage licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled off to jail. For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable. She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she's screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite! And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's her role only to enact it! Funny how all these \"Christians\" are preaching and practicing all this hate, eh? If Jesus were around today, his response would be most likely, \"What the hell is wrong with you people!\" #SameSexMarriage #MarriageEquality #Kentucky #SCOTUS #homophobia #bigotry"

        "text": "Barack Obama and his team have spent two months working to secure 41 percent for Iran deal. And now they claim enourmous victory. Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect \u2014 a legally binding long- term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed. Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in 2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama. But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a subject to a vote \u2014 not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his presidential veto. The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to overturn such a veto \u2014 and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So, instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67 senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to support the deal. Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42 percent. Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions."

And it may be assumed they were smarter than many liberals. The second amendment is deterrent. If a criminal knows you have a gun, he doesn't want to rob you. Of course, not all Americans have a gun, but criminals don't know who is unarmed. Liberals can say that guns increase crime rate. In fact, it is nonsense. Look at statistics: the most gun-friendly state is Wyoming, and it has low crime-rate. The states with high crime rate are states where there are many illegals as usual. So, liberal hysteria is just foolishness. Liberals find reasons of crimes in wrong places. The U.S. Constitution should be saved. Do you agree?"

If the government gives an amnesty to them who broke the immigration law, it doesn't respect Americans who love their country. Why citizens cannot break the law, but illegals can? What nonsense! Illegal immigrants work illegally and they don't pay taxes. Many of them commit a crime. And the police have no their finger prints because illegals have never obtained U.S. visa. If people want to live in the United States, they should require U.S. residence permit. Illegals should not be amnestied. How can we be the greatest nation in the world, if we don't respect our law? I am against illegals not because am chauvinist, but because I am patriot!"

Since then the U.S. Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times. All of amendments are steps that made the United States the greatest country in the world. The U.S. Constitution is not only the law, it is the basis of the country. Every true patriot respects it. Unfortunately, last decade has become the time of nihilism. More and more people don't respect American law. More and more people come to the United States and some of them don't feel reverence for our Constitution. It goes without saying that illegals who already broke the immigration law and will violate the supreme law easily. But the worst thing is that the current president of the United States and some high-ranking officials also spit upon the Constitution. They call for ban the right to bear arms, a confederate flag (I think this flag reflects not slavery, but important part of American history) and some liberals ban even the Old Glory -- a school district in Tennessee has banned all flags and banners, including the U.S. flag -- and so on. The same regards the Iran deal. America has a hard time. And we have to save the U.S. Constitution. We have to do it in God's name! America has to be great again because we are one nation under God!"

But the gang of anarchist thugs declared war against the police. I can't belive it's possible. The police administer the law. Law-abidingness is an important part of American life. Of course, history knows police mistakes, but a mistaken arrest is very rare occurance. At the same time, don't forget that officers risk their lives every day. Americans have to honor sacrifices of policemen. Police officers significantly improve the quality of life for the citizens of their communities by keeping the peace despite sometimes overwhelming odds. America has to stand against radical activists who threaten not only officers lives, but also our security."

The tragedy of September 11th is still touching us. Some of us lost our family members or our friends, while others saw the terrorist attacks firsthand. R.I.P to all innocent victims, workers, police officers, firefighters and even dogs that died in this tragedy. This is a day in our history that everyone is going to remember. Today we should honor the memory of the killed ones and share our stories. What were you doing on 9/11? I'd like to tell you #My911 Story. I was only 15 when the attacks occurred. I was at school. I remember that somebody came and told us that there had been a serious bombing in NYC. We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom called me crying. School was letting out early that day. When I came home I remember my dad watching the news and telling me that terrorists took responsibility for the attacks. And do you remember what you were doing on 9/11? #My911 Story"

Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the bishop of his local diocese on Spain's southern coast questioned his gender identity. Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery. Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family's request to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote to the Vatican for advice. Zornoza published the Vatican's reasoning for rejecting Salinas' wish. It said transsexual behavior \"reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one's own sexuality.\" The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time, the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just another superstition of Church. Funny."

The space warrior appears in Star Wars: Aftermath, which bridges the gap between Return of the Jedi and new film The Force Awakens. Sinjir, an Imperial turncoat who now serves in Luke Skywalker's Rebellion, is the first major gay role to be part of the Star Wars universe. He reveals his sexuality to female bounty hunter Jas Emari, who tries to chat him up. Chuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: \"I don't think his sexuality needs to be this giant plot point. At the same time, it's part of who he is. Isn't that great, guys? Ain't no lie, It's a big step forward. We want to thank the creators of the new \"Star Wars\" for the incredible courage and opposition to conservative bias in Hollywood cinema. There should be a special organization in Hollywood that will protect the rights of gay actors. There should be at least one gay character in every movie in order to help the American society get rid of homophobic stereotypes."

        "text": "The leader of radical religious group Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, announced that 20th anniversary Million Man March rally will take place on October 10, 2015 in Washington, D.C., at the National Mall. Organizers of the Million Man March call for justice, standing against the police and for blacks, Latinos and incarcerated. They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among radical groups. Only black activists say \"black lives matter\", forgetting the fact that justice is when all lives matter. Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should be imprisoned. Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's benevolent intentions. This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on American extremists to execute him. There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he should live here legally; he should not break the law. It's justice."

        "text": "The Justice Department is set to release about 6,000 inmates from federal prisons in a bid to reduce overcrowding. It is the largest one-time release of federal prisoners. The Department will release drug offenders who received harsh sentences over the last three decades. Every third of them is illegal immigrant. Barack Obama has criticized overblown sentencing laws that \"disproportionately impact communities of color.\" But is it indeed a reason to release criminals? If Latinos commit crimes often than whites, it doesn't mean that some Latino criminals should escape penalty."

But I reckon that I can't have the right to keep silence when outrageous things happen. I can't keep silence while stupid idiots forbid our children to wear patriotic clothes. I can't keep silence while Obama creates comfortable conditions for terrorists, accepting of 10,000 Syrian refugees. I can't keep silence while liberals spit on the U.S. Constitution. Yes, I criticize everything what is unacceptable for the nation. If Americans turn a blind eye to outrageous things, enjoying only positive moments of their lives, we will never live better. Criticism is a way for development. I'm a patriot, that's why I criticize."

So, Hillary Clinton said it's \"worth considering\" a nationwide gun ban and a \"buyback\" program to eradicate private gun ownership. Hillary says she is a democrat. Huh! No, she like Obama should say they're socialists who want to set up tyranny. The Founding Fathers had enough brains for preventing the situation when dictators run the country. They decided that armed nation is able to overthrow a tyrant. Maybe is it a true reason why Hillary Clinton stands against the Second Amendment?"

The goal was to \"disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations.\" Well, the intervention deprived al-Qaida of a sanctuary. But al-Qaida \u2014 even after its leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos \u2014 has spawned cells elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question is whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the mission that hardly can be called successful? It seems that Obama should review his military strategy without delay.Join us! Veterans USA(  @veterans GovSpending"

Hours later, two terrorists died in a shootout with San Bernardino police. One shooter still at large. It is known that gunmen are Muslims. They are very religious and probably linked with ISIS. California shooting should become a lesson for the administration \u2014 accepting refugees from Syria threatens the National security. It's tragedy. Enemies of America attacked our people again. Unfortunately, today we have no strong leader who is courageous enough to conquer terrorism. Nevertheless, we will not allow terrorists to change our way of life. We will not allow them to restrict our freedoms. We express our sincere condolences to families of victims in California shooting.

Can you imagine that a group of armed men took over a federal property and have vowed to kill if they are forced to leave there unless the government change the law in their favor. Nonsense! The ongoing Oregon standoff has taught us is that it's never been more apparent that the U.S. government values white lives above all others. The most stark example is comparing the kid-gloves treatment the white gunmen in Oregon are getting with the 1985 bombing of the MOVE house in Philadelphia. #GunmeninOregon #TheMove #1985Bombing"

Today, we do not see this equality among blacks and whites in America. These rights and privileges, freedom and justice shouldn't be for some selected few but all!"

In addition, more than half of the US's governors have said they will no longer provide placement for Syrian refugees, arguing that they pose too great a risk to national security. New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie has said his state will not take in any refugees \u2014 \"not even orphans under the age of five\". Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has said he has directed state police to \"track\" the Syrian refugees in his state, something his state police have played down. GOP presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush have suggested the US government prioritize Christian refugees. Barack Obama has pledged to veto the legislation, and has condemned the anti-refugee comments as \"un-American\", but experts worry the backlash could have dangerous consequences if these claims go unchecked. The stories you need to read, in one handy email Read more \"Sowing fear of refugees is exactly the kind of response groups like Isis are seeking,\" said lain Levine, deputy executive director for program at Human Rights Watch, on Thursday. \"Yes, governments need to bring order to refugee processing and weed out militant extremists, but now more than ever they also need to stand with people uprooted from their homes by ideologies of hatred and help them find real protection.\" http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-america- fact-from-fiction-congress Obama has condemned more than half of the US's governors as \u0300un-American' for saying they will no longer provide placement for Syrian refugees.

Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all these SJWs, let's refer to racial discrimination in the army of Union. A black soldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance. Almost a twofold difference! How tolerant tho! And what was going on in the \"racist\" Confederate States Army? Every soldier was paid $11/month until 1864 regardless of his skin color.

This is how it looks like when A White Police kills a black Civiliian, and also feels it's his right to sue the dead because sympathizers gave him a sleepless night. If it was lawful to kill Quintonio LeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops, then we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always rewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and segregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of inhumanity. The cops still things it wasn't enough killing a mentally disordered and an innocent woman. He still has the balls to sue even the dead. This is what living in America is like, if you are black."

Closeted minor leaguer for St Louis Cardinals quit after coach and players spoke of killing gay people Tyler Dunnington was a 28th-round pick by the St Louis Cardinals in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft and given a chance to pursue his dream of being in the big leagues. But after just one season pitching for a Cardinals minor league team and performing solidly, Dunnington quit. He explains that during his playing days, he was a closeted gay man playing in an uncomfortable environment. A particular low point came when a coach made a bragging reference to the brutal murder in Wyoming of gay college student Matthew Shepard whose death led to federal hate crime legislation in the US. And the hate goes on and on and on. ...Y ou need fight back! It's a shame all those \"big strong men\" are afraid of what somebody does in private!!"

The first of roughly 200,000 marchers began striding up Fifth Avenue just after 11 a.m. in a procession of throbbing pipes and drums, smiling dignitaries and waving flags. Thank you!!

We all deserve the right to be accepted. Go for it! Clicking the \"like\" button is not enough.

        "text": "A young black guy who was mentally disabled decided to end his life, but will only do that by making the cops kill him. This is absolutely insane in the highest order. He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

        "text": "Robert Bentley, Alabama Governor, has decided to reform prison system. This is actually good news? Alabama happens to be one of the nation's poorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison. The prison system houses 24,000 inmates but it was designed for 13,000.Let me enlighten you a little on how it's going to be done. Four other larger prisons will be built additionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have taught of using this money for projects like health care facilities and other, he chose prisons. It's not bad though, at least inmates will have free live behind bars. It shows how much he cares for his people.

She added old photos of late husband Deonta, but they were slightly faded to appear as a spirit \u2014 a symbol of hope that he watches over them. She also did this as a memorial for her unborn daughter who is due March 25. We commend her for her boldness and we hope that she finds solace in these photos. #NicoleBernett #Maternityphotoswithlatehusband"

Freeing himself from emotional trauma, Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them. Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American police find interest in \u2014 unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks. Very ridiculous.

        "text": "A 21-year-old Oklahoma man was sentenced on Monday to 40 years in prison for sexually assaulting orphaned children while on a missionary trip in Kenya in 2014. Matthew works at an orphanage built and run by an American citizen named Upendo Children Centre. The main aim of this orphanage was to assist abandoned children in Nairobi, Kenya. Upon Matthew's arrival in Kenya, he insisted on not staying in the apartment allocated to him by authorities but preferred to stay in the very dormitory where these children stayed. He also based his choice on being in a better position to assist the children should the need arise. Mathew raped three teenagers \u2014 ages of 5, 9, and 15 respectively for not less than 8 times. He also maltreated a 12 year old boy. This outrageous act led to his sentence of 40 years imprisonment and a fined of $15, 863."

        "text": "It is so disheartening knowing that people are put behind bars because they failed to settle a fine. Most people are jailed because one way or the other there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even though they were innocent. Prosecutors have developed this platform as a gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from civilians. You can be put behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one's life becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all these people who take advantages of people by making them pay huge sums of money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn't pay a fine.

They normally aimed at groups whom they opposed. The Klan held an anti- immigration rally on Saturday. They got surrounded by group of protestors who beat and kicked them violently. On Monday evening, a crowd of civil right protesters gathered for a vigil against Ku Klux Klan. It was a march where the protesters carried signs that had the inscription \"Power through Peace\". This march was an intended peaceful march which was meant to bring peace and unity.

The most annoying part is that they have refused to release the footage video. They need retraining. Whatever happened to Tasers? Whatever to rubber bullets?

        "text": "A young black guy who was mentally disabled decided to end his life, but will only do that by making the cops kill him. This is absolutely insane in the highest order. He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

That day, he says he was really scared, because he saw the 17 people \u2014 17 November, whatever it was, that they were walking around taking pictures. And he was afraid. He says it didn't look very good. And he was afraid. And that he asked for security, and he was turned down.\" This must be a mean joke we're having that kind of liar as a possible president. Even understanding that most liberals are brainwashed I just don't get it - how can a politician caught in a lie of that scale still be trusted by electorate? One must be totally insane to follow THAT kind of leader. Patricia's son is an American hero and his blood is on Hillary's hands."

        "text": "The liberal mass media tried to overblow a story about the KKK's endorsement of Trump. They claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and \"white supremacists\". The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared \"I don't know anything about David Duke... You're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking people I know nothing about.\" However, \"for some reasons\" the same mass media in their revelation campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton's ties to Robert Byrd, a former KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of \"surpassing eloquence and nobility\". In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying \"It is almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd. He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a government that improves the lives of the people it serves.\" So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate can't be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that. Isn't that a little hypocritical?"

Or maybe by \"good job\" she meant Obama's Government provided Hillary's sponsors like Wall-Mart Corporation with low- paid illegal workers? If one day God lets this liar enter the White House as a president \u2014 that day would be a real national tragedy."

        "text": "Hillary Clinton made new promises to extend our traitor President Obama's pro-immigration policy. She also promised to offer illegals residency and \"a path of citizenship\". During the debate on 8th March she was asked about deportation. Clinton said: \"I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That's a relatively small universe.\" Oh wonderful, so she admits she wants to be the second Obama, like the first one isn't enough. And we know what's behind this world \"children\" \u2014 young men who claim to be less than 18. Same way the \"illegals without a criminal record\" is also those who are not proved to be criminals yet. Crossing the U.S. border without permission is already a crime. A crime that should bring just one simple punishment \u2014 deportation and a prohibition of further entrance. We do not need a president who doesn't understand that. We do not need a president who forgives this kind of crime. We do not need Hillary."

        "text": "This Monday Clinton had a public interview event where she was asked to tell about Iraq war and Intervention in Libya during her being as a secretary of state. After attacks in Benghazi, after her actions and lies caused a national scandal, after officially being caught on lies she afforded herself to make a statement \"I've said Iraq was a mistake. Libya was a different kind of calculation. And we didn't lose a single person.\" More than three years passed after the accident and still Clinton didn't even contact Benghazi victims' families. She didn't even try to ask for excuse, like those murdered Americans don't even exist. We definitely don't need a President who lies without a twinge of conscience. Luckily most Americans won't trust such an obvious liar."

Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which occurred shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21 st St. That's just northeast of the Wichita State University campus. One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is a 19-year-old student who has chosen to remain anonymous. They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas money. When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him for money, one of the students attempted to intervene. The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who had gotten out of the car. The suspect called his friend \"brown trash\" and told him he had to \"leave this country,\" According to Usama's account, his friend responded: \"This is my country. Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?\" The incident \"escalated really quick,\" with the suspect attempting to punch his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said he was assaulted and knocked down. He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode circles around the two students, chanting \"Trump! Trump! Trump!\" and screaming, \"We'll make America great again! We'll throw you out of the wall!\""

We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential campaign, but did you support us before campaign? We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women and children, to die in their homes, and for what? Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AI- Gaddafi. You said in an interview: \"We came, we saw, he died\". Let's not forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security, and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were also injured in the attacks. You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat not only to the U.S. but the whole world! You are supporting gun control, disarming the American citizens and at the same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders, creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. 8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You change your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry, but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United States. Sincerely, United Muslims of America"

In an America where the Republican political party had a 44% very unfavorable view of Islam, despite 78% of the same Republican respondents saying they neither worked with nor had any Muslim friends. according to a YouGov poll conducted from 6 -9 March, 2015. In an America where failed businessman and top contender for the GOP nomination Donald Trump has publicly and unapologetically called for widespread surveillance on mosques, mass deportations, denial of asylum to all Muslims and has lauded a plan to shoot Muslims with bullets covered in pigs blood. So when Bernie Sanders acts like a human being and commits his prospective presidency (not to mention entire career) to combatting racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that Muslim Americans overwhelmingly support his bid for the White House."

In 1970, Rice was one of the two officers who were charged for the murder of Omaha police officer, Larry Minard. Authorities claim they coaxed Larry to a house with a 911 call, and then detonated a homemade bomb that killed him. He was the seventh-longest-serving inmate in Nebraska. Subsequent paroles and retrials were denied for these two men. Langa was in prison for 45 years. Details of the cause of his death are still unknown. Rest in peace, Mondo we Langa. #MondoweLanga #blackpanther #LarryMinard"

Each year the system incarcerates thousands of black men and women for minor violations, but they let go the murderers and rapists. What is wrong with our country???"

        "text": "ANOTHER BLACK MAN MURDERED IN POLICE CUSTODY. THINGS HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he had a \u00b0medical episode' at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest. On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas, was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail inmate. Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were followed. We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after \"fighting\" with the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in police custody."

So this time we would like to make a #flashmob against #HillaryClinton because she is the real enemy of black community and our followers prove it showing their disgrace to her personality and policy. That's why we ask you to do the same and send your photos to us. Why? Because we want to live in a better future and Hillary is not the person who will help us in getting justice and peace by all means! Dear followers, if you agree, just don't be ignorant to your future in America, join our flashmob and take a photo with #HillaryClintonForPrison2016 or #nohillary2016 and tag @blackmattersus!? Looking forward to your photos?? BlackMattersUS AmericanCops"

Jermaine Walker was arrested and sent to prison after the police officers and a state's attorney investigator had LIED UNDER OATH. They said that there was no surveillance camera in the alley where they arrested him ; even though it was and Walker said that! It's another prove that if you are black in this country; you are never safe. You can be arrested killed or imprison literally for the color of your skin. Walker's attorney said that Walker can obtain up to $170,000 for the time he spent in prison, but is it a good price for the 10 years of his life?! These bastards ruined this man's life and proved once again that there is not justice in this country!"

For example, Wisconsin suspended 26.6 percent of Black students compared to the 3 percent of white students. Also in Minnesota, Connecticut, Iowa and Nebraska black students were six times more likely than white students to be suspended from school. The racism in education is the reason why the school-to-prison pipeline exists. Our kids cannot even get a proper education, no wonder the success rate among black students is low. Somehow white people still think that education is only their privilege."

She was shot by the cop while she slept on a couch during a botched raid. The killer is still employed by the Detroit Police Department. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter and two lesser charges in her death, but the case was dropped in January 2015. Justice hasn't been served for Aiyana and her grieving family. We're planning a peaceful rally in front of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center on May 21 to honor the memory of Aiyana and other victims of police violence and demand demilitarization of police. We should draw as much attention as possible to the lack of justice for the families of those who lost their beloved ones at the hands of the police. Invite everyone you know and join us on May 21. We should stand up for the better future of our kids! The 6th Anniversary Of The Aiyana Jones' Death"

She gets hundreds of flirty messages every day and she laughs at the idea that changes someone's sexuality. Roby Rose thinks that it's not possible to change someone's sexuality because it's something you're born with and it's not changeable. I agree with her! Unfortunately, bigots like to say that homosexuality is a choice, so it can be \"cured\". Just like Ben Carson thinks that you're choosing to be gay and the prison is the proof of that. These ideas lead to thousands of broken lives. Why is it so hard to accept the fact that we were born this way?!"

I wonder how Hillary can even have military supporters, our soldiers have suffered enough from the liberal-in-chief for the last eight years. What's also confusing in that poll \u2014 almost every fifth polled soldier refuses to vote at all. It's a great demonstration out troops no longer trust the President, and Clinton would definitely not change the situation. No need to remind you what mistakes can Hillary do if allowed running our military forces \u2014we don't need another Iraq and we definitely don't need another Benghazi."

It happened in May 2015 and luckily had a happy end, as a result the students were allowed to attach our flag to their vehicles. The story ended well by efforts of dozens of patriots united to protest against High School authorities. It was a peaceful but strong and confident protest that made the authorities listen, it was a great example of how conscious people should act. We have to keep ready to stand against all kinds of attacks on American values and Constitutional laws. Unfortunately our current Government approves and even provokes these attacks, and the liberals' offensive and violent moods make it clear \u2014 every American patriot has to be careful and attentive."

Approximately 30,000 Marine Reservists may have suffered the same kind of exposure. Where were the liberals shouting about ecological problems? Why do they care about shutting down the coal industry to avoid mysterious unproved global warming but they don't mind thousands of Americans drinking poisoned water? Neither the VA officials nor our military commanders helped our Marines and now they just feel abandoned. Bob Miranda-Boulay said \u0300I don't count' \u2014 that is what our veterans feel. That is not an attitude they deserve. \"I wanted to make a difference,\" Boulay said. \"I love my country and I wanted to do the right thing. I wanted to be a Marine.\" That is a real shame our veterans feel being betrayed by our country leaders."

        "text": "The Civil Rights Movement was fighting for the real equality in general and particularly the equal rights of voting. It started in North Carolina but it can spread all over the country. Blacks are being deprived of general voting rights. The U.S. District Judge, Thomas Schroeder, on Monday dismissed lawsuits challenging changes to the state's election laws, declaring that the challenges failed to show that it hindered voters of color from exercising their voting rights. The North Carolina law which eliminated early voting, same \u2014day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting requires voters who go to the polls to show an acceptable form of identification such as a driver's license, passport or military ID. This is not a good sign as we watch the world take the new turn for the worse now while doing nothing.

        "text": "A new report showed that West Virginia and 11 other states have to the highest percentage of children with a parent who is or was incarcerated. Can you believe these numbers? Of course, the highest incarceration level is among the black population of the country. The system is enslaving us with the help of the jails and it affects the whole community. Kids have to grow up not knowing their fathers and not having the support they need to make rights choices and school-to-prison pipeline doesn't leave them much of a choice. The kids grow up in extreme poverty without the access to the basic things like healthcare or education. The system is build to keep as many black people in the jails as possible. Being black in the US means being in a constant danger! You never know when you will be killed or sent to prison, because of the color of your skin. I've never heard white media talking about it, do you?"

All the liberal attacks on it are very worrying because the Amendment was not only made for self defense \u2014 it is a nation's ability to overthrow the tyranny. A Government that doesn't trust its citizens to possess weapons can never receive mutual trust or respect. And that's what things are now \u2014 there's a great mistrust between the people and the country Administration and the only way for our \"leaders\" to establish relations with Americans is to stop all attacks on the Second Amendment."

Hospital staff and Roberto's family arranged his final meeting with two horses. Gonzalez was paralyzed in Vietnam during his service. He gave his health away in the name of America like thousands of our brave soldiers did. Unfortunately no one can return their health and lives back. Our best people have to live the shortest lives. If only our Government could pay more attention to our heroes' problems to make them a bit happier and to make their heroic lives a bit longer."

Retired marine Frank Larison recently received a letter by the HOA, ordering him to remove his \"marine stickers\" from his Chevy car. Frank and his lawyer claim that he will face $50 a day if he refuses to do so. If he does not play those fines, he will be towed. Have you ever heard of someone receiving a notification to remove Obama stickers? LGBT stickers? Those terrorists Black Lives Matter stickers? Well, me neither! The liberal rage comes only to those who love the Old Glory or U.S. Armed Forces. Our whole society is ill. Libtards are allowed to do whatever they want while even the smallest demonstration of love and devotion to America causes an immediate intervention from the authorities."

He held the title for less than a month following the death of Felix Simoneaux Jr. on April 19. Wish our veterans received more attention and care from our Government. Obama's eight presidency years turned into a disaster to our veterans and soldiers. Hope Obama will be replaced by a President who cares.

But despite these efforts, students who are LGBT continue to face a harsh reality.... May 24,25 Westboro baptist church is planning to stand against tolerance in education system near LGBT-friendly Lawrence High School. They want to \"remind this nation that the parents, students, teachers and staff of the high schools celebrate disobedience to God's law.\" They are just inciting hate riots and violence! Their right to protest infringes on others rights! Personally have had enough of those idiots. Someone should picket them (in return)!!

First of all, Benghazi: four people died on her watch and she did not send help. Secondly, Hillary refused to apologize to all veterans, when she has made several remarks about veterans \"embellishing\" the situation at the VA. Finally, Hillary is the only one politician (except Barack Obama) who is despised by the overwhelming majority of American veterans. If Hillary becomes the President of the US, the American army should be withdrawn from Hillary's control according to the amendments to the Constitution."

The Austin School Board voted 8-1 to change the name Monday night.The school board had three name options from which to choose: Russell Lee, a photographer from the school's neighborhood who started UT's photography program. The board approved Russell Lee at the request of the school's Campus Advisory Council. So, what can I say? This is a disgrace for the Texas authorities! I am shocked at the dismantling of southern history. We know that our ancestors fought for our freedom. These names were, are and always will be the part of Texas history. Why is Texas administration willing to do anything what feds say them? Isn't it obvious that the Federal government aims to destroy our history? This is a madness! Therefore, I need to ask you: are you ready to defend our Heritage? The Southern history needs protection now more than ever before!"

Dawud Abdulwali attended a party in a Hollywood hotel where he ranted about the August 2014 killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson. According to one of the witnesses; he was so mad about the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building. Abdulwalia's anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should not be tolerated. But we have to start thinking about the message he was trying to send: having a black president changes almost nothing."

The Methodist Episcopal Church have decided that the families will have to divide $1.5 million in donations, while they will keep $1.8 million; with plans to make long-needed repairs to the church. For instance, the wife of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney who was among those killed by white shooter Dylan Roof, has not received any of the donation proceeds. Nothing will bring the victims of Charleston massacre back, but this money will help aid in bridging the gap in the loss of an income. Donations are important for these families since they did not receive a cent from the government."

Patriots carried and waved American flags, while the Clinton/Sanders supporters carried MEXICAN flags and attempted to confront a very diverse group of Donald Trump supporters. That explains why the Democrats encourage the illegal immigration. They are ready to destroy America just to be elected. We have to defend this nation! Let's organize rallies against the illegal immigration around the whole country! Let's flood the United States with American flags! If you have a desire to organize a rally in your city, please contact us. We can help you. Only our patriotism can save the United States of America!"

But one problem is destroying our country more than anything else. Illegal aliens affect our economy drastically. Not only they sink the job market and steal hundreds of millions of welfare dollars, they also flood America with drugs, which is the worst. Mexican cartels have a stable stream of drugs through the border and our government does nothing with it. To cure our nation we need to get rid of all the gangs and illegal immigrants and build a huge wall so they would never come back!"

        "text": "All people have to understand that the police service is exactly like a secret gay club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even if it's evident. There's a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But if you are in a member of a club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly enough, \"Sworn officer of the court\" is most likely to lie than the citizen he is even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code of silence, and it's a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

        "text": "President Barack Obama signed a bill Friday eliminating the offensive and outdated descriptors, after the legislation passed unanimously in the House and Senate earlier this month. Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) sponsored the bill, which aimed to \"modernize\" two references to \"Orientals\" and \"Negros\" in the U.S. Code that date to the 1970's. The words will be replaced with \"Asian Americans\" and \"African Americans,\" respectively. \"The term \u0300 Oriental' has no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be gone for good,\" Meng said in a statement on Friday. Obama signed the bill shortly before leaving for his trip to Vietnam and Japan, where he will become the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima.

        "text": "Hate does seem to be a Christian ideal.... 3rd federal court case seeks to block Mississippi LGBT law A diverse group of gay, straight and transgender people have filed the third federal court challenge seeking to block a Mississippi law that lets clerks cite religious beliefs to recuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses to same- sex couples. The lawsuit filed Friday says House Bill 1523 violates the separation of church and state by favoring \"certain narrow religious beliefs that condemn same-sex couples who get married, condemn unmarried people who have sexual relations and condemn transgender people.\" How many times do we have to do this? Your BELIEFS don't supersede my RIGHTS!! You just want to use your religious beliefs as an excuse to deliberately harm others and have no consequences for doing so! You can believe whatever you wish, but you cannot use those beliefs to deny me my rights!"

Obama is nothing more than an ignoramus and provocateur shamelessly mocking the Bible. Thanks God, the national nightmare is almost over. He tries to create as many conflicts among the population as it's possible destroying everything we hold of worth."

Democrats, gunsense zealots, moms, students, professors and store owners told us that open carry WOULD be a problem, but as it turned out, there wasn't any. Yes, people are scared of people walking up carrying guns. But the truth is they don't realize that there much more people who carry guns illegally. That's why open carry is a guarantee of peace and stability in Texas."

But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper.\" (Qur'an 4:89) This Surah is an evidence of how Syrian refugees respect our culture. If you think that Muslims ignore some Islamic rules, you're wrong. For example, a Muslim in eastern Uganda strangled his Christian wife to death this month for leaving Islam. What would you do if your wife or husband converts to Islam? Probably you would be upset. In the worst case, you would sue for divorce. But I'm sure you would not kill your spouse. That's the difference between our cultures."

        "text": "Muhammad Ali, the greatest boxer this world has ever known, is no more. The fact that he is gone is difficult to come to terms with; for years, Ali was renowned as a larger than life figure, the greatest, as he called himself, and the demise of a man of such a high stature is surely a void that can never be filled. In the world of sports, Muhammad Ali will forever be known as the boxing legend who won 56 bouts over the period of a 21-year career. In popular culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed. He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War. Furthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was accused of committing a felony. Now that he is gone, this world is left with memories, and a void that cannot be filled. May Allah rest his soul in peace and paradise!!!"

So, Bernie has the point. I appreciate the way he maintains his independent opinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the \"second Democratic option\". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than an \"organized crime\" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers' money! Hillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged feminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary has always been a \"defender\" of the minorities. So, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me. What's your opinion on that point?"

A few days ago there were started the #MoveYourMany campaign which the main goal is to demonstrate the value of Black lives within America. At the request of rapper Killer Mike, over 8,000 people have transferred their money into Black-owned banks in the last 5 days. 50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. requested Blacks to replace their funds from non-Black banks to Black-owned institutions which would help to empower and advance Black community. The best way to fight the system is to break its capitalist back which is why it is important for Blacks to invest in ourselves!"

        "text": "A lone sniper shot 14 people and killed 5 police officers, in Dallas late Thursday night. It was a peaceful protest against the police shootings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. So he turned this peaceful protest into a scene of chaos and carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two civilians. The sniper, Micah X. Johnson was a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war. As he was captured, he claimed he wanted to \"kill white people\". There's no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There's no proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago and the police can't show anything to prove there was a link between Micah X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us time and again that \u00abblack lives matter terrorists are killing the police officers\u00bb. The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is a violent anti-government riot!

Most problems we face happen because we've stopped calling things by their names and the assassination of cops in Dallas was no exception. We're hiding behind political correctness and denying the truth because we don't want to \u0300 offend' someone. And the truth is: a group of people calling their supporters to commit violence is not a peaceful group. A group of people coming to their opponent's rallies and attacking peaceful people is a group of extremists. A group of people standing behind the attack on police is a group of terrorists. The Black Lives Matter are terrorists, and the sooner we admit it officially \u2014 the sooner this war on cops will end and people running a conservative rally won't be afraid to be attacked by a hateful gang.

If you think it was just a coincidence, you make a mistake. Johnson got set up in one building and moved more than 10 miles away to another building owned by the same people to shoot from. It doesn't look like it is a coincidence. Moreover, some witnesses said that they saw Jonson visiting a mosque. Muslims seem to be not peace-loving as they say. And I don't want to see 10.000 potential terrorists here in Texas."

That's why we have to support all police officers who refused to applaud Obama. Taking sides with these rioters and racists, Obama literally called for open war against police officers and whites.

So, Bernie has the point. I appreciate the way he maintains his independent opinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the \"second Democratic option\". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than an \"organized crime\" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers' money! Hillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged feminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary has always been a \"defender\" of the minorities. So, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me. What's your opinion on that point?"

Crystal Raquel Cash, 55, cannot speak but is alive after being shot nearly point blank in the face by a member of Christian hate group. The attacker, Gerald Duane Lewis, 26, and his wife reportedly are members of the Israel United in Church, which the Southern Poverty Law Center listed as a hate group last year. According to the newspapers, Lewis was wearing a shirt from the church when he opened fire, shouting a homophobic slur. The government must pay more attention to assaults on sexual minorities because this is the threat to the country's internal security!"

        "text": "A demonstration which was held on Tuesday in response to the recent fatal police shooting of Philando Castile resulted in the arrest of 46 people outside the governor's mansion in St. Paul, Minnesota. Another arrest was carried out the following day, during the morning hours where 23 protestors were arrested and charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July 7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have been embarking on demonstration outside the governor's home but police officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there. Even though the street was cleared few days after July 18, some protesters have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

        "text": "Do you know that the white Milwuakee officer who was fired from his job after fatally shooting a mentally ill Black man in 2014 has gotten his job back? This is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black person's life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back \u2014 for the second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired. It is now absolutely clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

        "text": "Black people have no place in the coming 2016 presidential election because we have had our chance and we never profited out of it. We had a moment to present economic or social advancement plans to president Obama, yet we refused and let anti- blacks trick us into thinking that was not elected to benefit just black people alone. President Obama was elected for a reason. He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great. The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by day because those in position are descending from the ladder every day. In no time; \"White Power' will be stronger than before.

The wrong course had been chosen by the American government; but all those politicians are too far from the border to see who actually sneaks through it illegally. Rapists, drug dealers, human traffickers; and others. The percent of innocent poor families searching for a better life is too small to become an argument for amnesty and Texas warm welcome."

Hillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa Caucus. At the same time, she has already demonstrated that she prefers destroying the nation than losing election. She pledged not to deport illegal aliens. Moreover, it's known that Hillary is going to take in about one million Muslim refugees, if she is president. \"I'm telling you, Nov. 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us.\""

October 22nd is a day that people around the nation have mobilized every year since 1996 for a National Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a Generation. Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims and quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well- known case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man, who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot. We need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and serve! Not to kill, damage and cripple! Join us on October 22, in Charlotte, 600 East Trade Street, just between Charlotte City hall and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. National Day of Protest. Charlotte, NC"

The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no. We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE! Use our page to team up with other locals. Invite your friends and family, spread the word and let's make this effort together! Get Ready to Secede!"

However, most of these athletes paid the price for this demonstration. For instance, on September 10, after getting permission from league officials, the staff and the students of the Beaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. On the next day, the students and the staff received death threats. Moreover, the executive board decided to suspend Coach RahORah Barber for the rest of the season and canceled the whole football season. So now we know what opposition might face in this country."

And here are some real Clinton decisions: \u2014Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had been exaggerated by Republicans. \u2014In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007 supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans' medical care. -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20 million for veterans' health care facilities. -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.\" In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad! Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!"

Oh, and let's not forget gentrifiers. Or, as I like to call them, \"white migrators.\" Apparently, instead of knocking on a neighbor's door, people take the easy and passive-aggressive way out and just leave notes instead. But one man wasn't having it.

        "text": "Boston police shot and killed a man wearing body armor and wielding an assault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William Evans. A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33, of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October 12.H e was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire themselves. This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against cops, will become the President of the United States. Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country. Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse racism, against those who want to destroy America! Among all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend the police from terrorists."

After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher manhandling a small child on Facebook, the video went viral and it was shared thousands of times. In the video footage, Vann also tells the boy: \"Tell me no. When I tell you to do something, you do it, boy.\" After the Burleson County Sheriff's Office launched an investigation, a \"behavior specialist\" who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young student was fired. The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who abuse any child. The teachers who use excessive force against any child should be removed immediately from the classroom and placed on administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen."

They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party \"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country\". They tried to close it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was dissolved. 50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that can make Black Lives really matter. Let's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has made the change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their ideas and ideals! Black Panther Party 50th Anniversary"

Killer cops involved in the shooting won't face discipline. Chief Janee Harteau recently said that an internal investigation found the officers were warranted in using deadly force in the death of the 24-year-old black man. It's been a year since he died. Justice still hasn't been served. Come out to honor the memory of Jamar on November 19. We won't stop until change is here! #blacklivesmatter Remember Jamar Clark"

October 22nd is a day that people around the nation have mobilized every year since 1996 for a National Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a Generation. Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims and quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well- known case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man, who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot. We need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and serve! Not to kill, damage and cripple! Join us on October 22, in Charlotte, 600 East Trade Street, just between Charlotte City hall and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. National Day of Protest. Charlotte, NC"

The man was arrested right in the Capitol and charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief. It is not clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale. Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how liberal propaganda influences even on Southern people. The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people's respect. It is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names! We should protect our history and fight against liberal brainwashing."

Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would be exposed to, and of their need of protection. And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends."

        "text": "HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANS The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are some real Clinton decisions: \u2014Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had been exaggerated by Republicans. \u2014In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007 supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans' medical care. -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20 million for veterans' health care facilities. -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.\" In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad! Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!"

BUT, let those reasons be genuine! Let them be your reasons, not influenced upon or manipulated in any way. I'm proud of this mama not because she didn't vote #Hillary or #Trump, but simply because she did her research, decided for herself, in her interest and the interest of her kids, and voted consciously!

        "text": "CHARLESTON COP WHO FATALLY SHOT BLACK MAN ASKS JUDGE TO DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year- old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to drop murder charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the shooting. According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self- defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times, hitting Scott five times from behind. Slager's defense attorney's: \"The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split- second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.' The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire. We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay."

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley, who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars. When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting. After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and was pronounced dead. Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, \"It's Up to Us,\" she was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because ignoring it can take away years of people's lives. Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half of people shot by cops are mentally ill? Police officers are not equipped with firearms to deal with mental illness in the field. But they are equipped to protect us from criminals."

The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between $65,000 and $75,000 per year. Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African- Americans. Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities. Find out how to escape bad credit reports: goo.gl/GArVbz"

        "text": "Joshua was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Indianapolis. Two months before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two sons. Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in Indianapolis at the age of 26. Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off- duty firefighter. The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said. Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her off \u2014 who she believed was a Chicago police officer \u2014 stopped and got out of their cars. At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley. She said the man got inside his car but exited again and \"he just started shooting,\" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal legally owned the gun and did not fire it. Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began shooting him. \"I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,\" said Boxley. Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year- old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother. \"This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They have no consideration for life,\" - Tiffaney Boxley. Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own death, armed or unarmed. #joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice"

I opted out of the elections and i had many Black people all up in my case, telling me how i was wrong and how i needed to make my vote count for Mrs. Clinton, all just to make sure Trump doesn't become president. Well now all i want to say is get over Trump and Clinton, they are rich white people, the elite who were born into and are a part of the system.

        "text": "On October 26,2016, a black man was slammed and beaten by police officers at the train station. According to a witness, the man who was arrested had originally been driving across the light rail tracks, when officers on foot attempted to stop his car, at which point, he drove off. He added that the man \"wasn't resisting at all until they tased him\" After tasing the man police officers used their elbows and fists, as the man lay on the ground, screaming for help. The man was heard screaming in pain: \"My fucking back is killing me! Oh god! My back!\" In a statement, released on November 2, Minneapolis Police Department confirmed the arrest, but said that a fuller video would show that the officers' conduct was justified."

But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating to the Black Youth Project 100. Kaepernick donated to the Chicago chapter of the organization toward \"Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to Build Black Futures\" which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States of America. \"I'll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those communities,\" he said. When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don't really care about haters. Good job, Colin."

Often times, we overlook our own businesses to purchase products and services from businesses outside of our communities. Many of us have heard the disturbing statistic about a dollar circulating within the black community for only 6 hours compared to approximately 2-4 weeks in white, Jewish, and Asian communities. If we don't support our entrepreneurs, how can we expect others to support our amazing businesses? We must continue to educate and change the mindset of consumers so \"buying black\" becomes the norm amongst our people and not only an encouragement during the holiday season,\" said Lonzell Fogle and Breyon Williams, founders of My Suited Life."

Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe Street that's being displaced by development says he's doing it to make a statement. \"It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something that's not done here by black folk. said Joseph Wicks; who now owns the house at 33 Woolfe St. \u0300 None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted toward black folk.\" Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most. The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it cant be torn down! I'm so proud of this man! He is making a real movement! Actions like this can protect our history!"

Manville continued to study while incarcerated and eventually earned two college degrees during his sentence. He became enamored with the legal profession and went to law school right after his parole. He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards, Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented various inmates and prison guards in civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches law at Michigan State University, where he hopes the insights he shares with students inspire them to someday help improve the system as well. \u2014ListVerse-r"

As a teenager, Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles. By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for cooking, while he was on kitchen duty. He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some of LA's top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land a job at Caesar's Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All the fame and success hasn't gotten to Henderson's head though and he has continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can achieve in life with the right choices."

Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would be exposed to, and of their need of protection. And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends."

Sarah and her partner Kyle Harris created a movie about the journey called \"The Water Gap: Return to the Homelands\" which already won the award at the Native American Film Festival of the Southeast. Propaganda of native culture and traditions is one of most powerful weapons in Native American fight for their rights. People have always tried to destroy things they don't understand. And white people never understood native culture properly. Many teens who had native ancestors deep in the past know nothing about their culture. Films, journeys, even videos on Youtube, can help."

After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in April 2014. The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned braids and twists amidst the criticism. Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight. Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks caused a lot of unnecessary stress. The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option. Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half- inch wide. Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have different hair texture."

        "text": "Drum and Spear Bookstore in Washington DC was opened by veteran members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee( SNCC) in summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company. One of co-founders said \"We don't define profit in terms of money. The profit is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to self-support.\" Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history, something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of the shop: the drum is for \"communications within the diaspora,\" and the spear symbolizes \"whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the people.\" The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice. This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores. Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a \"free spaces\" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear today, in 2017. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #drumandspear #blackpower"

She began to take him to local museums such as the Apex, the Sights and Sounds Black Cultural Museum and the Fernbank Museum of Natural History. To improve Leon's skills of painting he began to attend art classes of R. Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth Business Organization (SWAYBO) also helped Leon in many ways. According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of \"poise and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black community.\" Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book with his illustrations is As Big As God. That's what we call the support of family and the community! Good luck, Leon! We should believe in ourselves just like Leon's mother believed in him. Our roots are strong; just imagine how strong you can be if only you grow with your roots! #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #leonmoss #art #blackart"

Education for the Black people was never easy, starting slave period when Black people could be killed for reading a book, including today when thousands of kids cannot get the education because of their skin color and the prejudice of the teachers, and this girl is proving that times are changing. Recently Black women were called the most educated group of people in the US and years by, we can see that those women are starting to make changes. Here and there we hear the news about Black people holding the positions for the first time in history and trust me, it's just a beginning! We are so happy to see the whole nation waking up and realizing the importance of both hustle and education."

My mother didn't know about the school-to-prison pipeline, she just knew she had a black boy.\" Coleman explained how his work with wrongfully-convicted clients had shaped his view of the U.S. criminal justice system, which he described as racially lopsided. \"It's not by choice that most of my clients are African American,\" Coleman said. \"It's a fact of life and of the prison system. If most of the people going into the system are black men, most of my clients will be too.\" The Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy hosted a symposium Tuesday focusing on efforts to improve criminal justice and the American prison system. Titled \"Intersectionality and the Black Lives Matter Movement,\" the event featured a panel of speakers, including James Coleman, John S. Bradway professor of the practice of law, and Umar Muhammad, community organizer for the Southern Coalition for Justice, along with Theresa Newman, clinical professor of law. \"I didn't feel prepared for the world. I didn't feel rehabilitated. I had no resources,\" Muhammad said. -The Chronicle-"

        "text": "\"First and foremost, we as Chicago Public School students would like to thank you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to improve our Chicago... All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility away from artists, but it hasn't changed you... We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you. Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be successful, still be self-made... Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we know and love, Chicago. Sincerely, Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt Lake View High School Students Chicago, Illinois\" It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back. It should work. As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love. That's cool that this love goes back and forth! We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #chancetherapper #chicago #music #hiphop #rap"

Perez moved to Chicago when he was 8-years- old and was a permanent legal resident. He joined the U.S. Army and served two tours of duty in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury in an explosion. Perez served seven years; but because he is not a U.S. citizen, Immigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and began the deportation process. This system doesn't appreciate our sacrifices. America was designed that way it will only benefit gringos. Miguel Perez is a real hero, who was betrayed by America. When will we have real justice in this country?"

It wasn't easy to follow the dream for Ebony. Or it's better to say that there were some hardships \u2014 for example, Ebony was growing without a father etc, but despite these things she successfully got the proper education and became the first black female anesthesiologist in 2013. Hilton says she never had plan B. Now she is mentoring youth as a member of program called Girls Loving OurSelves Successfully (GLOSS). That's sweet. Black women always show the power in any conditions. That's inspiring! And it's especially good that Hilton dedicated herself to teaching others. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #ebonyhilton #blackgirlmagic"

People should know the origins, not to confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird. White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise. Same goes to African Americans who copy white people. Know yourself! We have beautiful culture and history! #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity"

When white people do something for us they see us as strangers anyway, we will always be \"others\" for them. Thankfully there were a lot of African Americans who devoted their lives to community.

We made the first cattle drive, started the first ranches, we were the first ranchers, miners, mountain men, cowboys etc. in what is now the U.S. Everything changed when white colonists came. Europe was rejecting the worst people so those; who were arriving at our lands were killers, rapists; murderers, thieves and other scum. So, why are their descendants worried about immigrants? They forgot that what goes around comes around!"

She says: \"Diversity on the bench is so important because the people that come to court come from all different walks of life, different ethnic backgrounds, different religious backgrounds.\" However, if it's a sign of diversity, this is a very weak sign. Just think, we are indigenous inhabitants of this land and we were cut off all privileges since gabachos came and stole our land. So, it took almost 500 years for our woman to reach a prestigious position in the government that is not really caring about us! Whether there are latinos or not, authorities will continue to deport us from our indigenous land!"

This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the woman tell Lim, \"Check my bag. I'm telling you I don't have anything.\" And why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what? Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg chapter of the NAACP demanded that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, I want it be not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black people were treated disrespectfully! We don't believe apologies, especially when we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose! Williams&Kalvin www.youtube.com"

Disturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman! This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the woman tell Lim, \"Check my bag. I'm telling you I don't have anything.\" And why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what? Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg chapter of the NAACP demanded that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, I want it be not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black people were treated disrespectfully! We don't believe apologies, especially when we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose!"

According to a police report; 21-year-old Demetrius Hollins was pulled over near Lawrenceville for changing lines several times without signaling. When cops stopped him ; Hollins was seen on video standing with his hands raised before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face; and the second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Hollins in his face. The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame. This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal charges. even though they admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice?

        "text": "Shocking video was captured by the police officer body cam. On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light. The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll down her window \"all the way\" to receive her ticket. When King refused, which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply citing her, the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground. When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police ends brutally for Black people and nothing seems to change. Video source @[540176322666035:274:P olice The Police]"

Some believed Trump would withdraw the U.S. from useless and bloody military campaigns. But what we see is only the enhancement of hostility. We don't need wars no more! We want peace! It's time for politicians to take care of the U.S. residents instead of fating them, as well as other nationals, to death. We're organizing a peaceful gathering to draw public attention to the above- mentioned terrible problem. Our President and Congress must listen to those who granted them power - us, the people. If you also think that there should only be peace, come with us and let's make it happen. Stop war! Stop killing the innocent! Make peace, not war! Make peace, not war!"

        "text": "The US-led coalition strike in Syria's Raqqa province killed 12 women, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said this morning. The second coalition strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more civilians. Just to make it clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this is more and more civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%. However, terrorists weren't destroyed in '30 days' and it seems like they won't be destroyed in the closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war 'for freedom', it's another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood money is the main goal of it. For America, another continuous military conflict can lead to a financial crisis, this is exactly what happened in 2008."

That's why the US often offers Mexicans to join the armed forces, in exchange for what they promise to give American citizenship. In this regard, Mexicans are often sent to the war zone in Syria or other countries, from where they sometimes do not return. Many Mexicans have to go for it, as today the process of obtaining American citizenship can last for years and even dozens of years. The US policy towards Mexicans is becoming increasingly brutal, therefore, it is necessary to stop any attempts by the US government to send Mexicans to the war zones, where they fight for any unknown goals."

Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his Grandfather's shotgun that was given to his mother for protection.

After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end Obama's policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas. \"We're not going into Syria\", Trump said it to calm down those who got really concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war. Here's what Ron Paul thinks about it: \"By the end of this month, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send his national security team back to the drawing board \u2014 or replace them. There is no way another \"surge\" in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria) puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will succeed any better than it did the last time.\" Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We've started the whole Afghanistan thing to beat the Soviets, and no there's no Soviet Union on the world map, and all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian students."

Our military presence in Syria now doesn't serve American interests. Our soldiers are there to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for Americans. And that's why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly opposite to the \"America First\" concept. I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he's trying make a deal out of it, but there's one important thing here: under no circumstances can our soldiers' lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential campaign Trump said \"let's bring back our soldiers home\", and now it's really time to do it. This is not our war."

We've been watching our military commandership wasting lives of American soldiers for too long, let's hope it will end now when Trump is in charge. A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa. We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all. Unfortunately that's hardly possible because of the corruption in the Government. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator McCain, and that's why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but also getting involved into another regime change venture and possibly another oil war. We're fighting radical Islamists, but we're also siding with Syrian opposition, the very same radical Islamists, and there's absolutely no guarantee that these rebels won't replace ISIS when it's gone. There's only one chance to avoid another Iraq: Trump and the American nation must defeat globalist politicians and the Establishment. All we can do now is to pray for all American soldiers to return back home alive and safe."

Words can't heal their pain; our tears won't bring back those who left us already; nothing can console our grief right now. However, we have the duty to save those whose lives are still at risk. For the sake of these people, we have to work to end this terrible war. Unfortunately, we haven't seen much development in this direction. Bombing random targets and going for momentary aims, taking reckless decisions and shifting our focus off crushing terrorists only leads to more casualties among civilians and creates even more suffering. We have to stick to our agenda and work to protect people, launching additional missiles on them won't help. Pray for peace to return to Syria and work sanely to bring this moment closer!"

Unfortunately, many of these hypocrites have infiltrated the American establishment. Such people benefit from regional conflicts and war is nothing more than business for them. It was these people who launched the missiles that never hit no terrorists but led to civilian casualties. It is them who keep receiving money from the same actors who sponsor ISIS and other groups. These people want more American involvement because it means more money for them and they don't care about the terrorists. In fact, radicals really help them increase their bloody income. The only way to resist the corrupt elites is to oppose military actions with no particular aim and promote anti-terrorist agenda! Focus on what's truly important and we will end the war in Syria sooner than you can imagine."

        "text": "New administration's budget proposal to Congress includes $1.7 trillion in mandatory spending cuts over 10 years, including $800 billion from Medicaid and $193 billion from food stamps. At the same time, this proposal, called \"A New Foundation for American Greatness\", includes a boost in military spending and $1.6 billion for the construction of the border wall with Mexico. To be honest, I'm not sure, that the wall and another pointless war, instead of affordable health care and help for those in need, is what we have to keep our focus on. It seems like republicans are using every single possibility to get more money for their wars, and they don't mind it if average Americans live in poverty or without affordable medicine. Why additional billions to Military? Our Department of Defense budget is already bigger than military budgets of the next eight countries combined, isn't it enough? Here is what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: \"Based on what we know about this budget, the good news -- the only good news -- is that it's likely to be roundly rejected by members of both parties here in the Senate \u2014 just as the last budget was\""

        "text": "The administration is requesting a $54 billion increase in military spending for 2018. Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of 2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31%  cut in the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high- powerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative energy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use every opportunity to start another war, they are acting the same way in Syria. Start thinking!"

He said that sending troops to Syria was a very difficult decision, but not bombing Syria was even harder to make. Obama was hated for not taking actions, but it's better for being hated for not killing innocent people that for starting a useless war. Though it was tough, Obama did a great job keeping away from the war that would take millions from the US budget and get innocent people killed. Unfortunately, the recent government didn't think twice, before they started bombing Syria. They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill innocent kids in Syria. How did we come to this?!"
