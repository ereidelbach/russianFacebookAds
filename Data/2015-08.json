The first lesson of Obama's policies is to disregard the first lesson of economics... USA TO ISSUE MORE GREEN CARDS THAN POPULATIONS OF IOWA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, SOUTH CAROLINA COMBINED. The lion's share of these visas are for lesser-skilled and lower-paid workers and their dependents who, because they are here on work-authorized visas, are added directly to the same labor pool occupied by current unemployed jobseekers. Expressly because they arrive on legal immigrant visas, most will be able to draw a wide range of taxpayer-funded benefits, and corporations will be allowed to directly substitute these workers for Americans. Improved border security would have no effect on the continued arrival of these foreign workers, refugees, and permanent immigrants\u2014because they are all invited here by the federal government. Obama swore an oath to uphold our Constitution and protect the American people but he has done everything in his power to destroy us.

They want to keep the border open so violent illegal aliens can victimize our citizens Jindal said that in a trip to the border, he witnessed illegal aliens easily gaining entry. \"I saw three groups come right across in broad daylight,\" he said. \"One group walked across a man-made dam, got to a fence... they swing the gate wide open. It's not even locked.\" America floods the country with people who have no job skills and offer them a living on welfare. Voila, we have a work ethic breakdown. I think, it's time for government to do their job and protect our country. America for Americans!"

The kids that need foster care come from heterosexual families. So I think the straights should be banned from being foster parents! A Kansas Department of Children and Families official said that the state will continue to allow qualified single adults to serve as foster parents for abused and neglected children, but she said her agency isn't ready to say whether it will allow married same-sex couples to do so. Oh God ... Just because your gay doesn't make you any less of a human or any less deserving of any right afforded to anyone else! Anyone who believes that a gay person is below a straight person needs treatment! It is time for this freaking discrimination to end! They have no valid reasons for denying married gays from adopting and fostering kids. All they are doing is denying kids loving homes because of their own bigotry."

        "text": "Most parents aren't prepared for the words, \"Mom, Dad. I'm gay.\" For many parents first reaction probably will be \"How will I ever handle this?\" The answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your continued relationship with your son or daughter. Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during that time. Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're hearing (\"It's just a phase; you'll get over it\"); by shutting down (\"If you choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it\"); or by not registering the impact of what we're being told (\"That's nice, dear, and what do you want for dinner?\"). Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person. It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through \"a phase\". On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, \"Is she/he sure?\" the answer will almost always be \"yes\"! DON'T BE YOUR CHILD'S FIRST CLOSET! #children #lgbt #momdadimgay #gayisok #comingout #acceptance"

A copy of the alert said that the wife of a U.S. military member was approached in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May. Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June. We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the U.S. military has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don't fully perform their duties. First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to identify people who scour after the wives and children of the U.S. Military. Secondly, families of the U.S. Military should be taken under special protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the U.S. Military family members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn't worth a dime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a negative scenario there won't be any need in their work. And this will be the final nail in the coffin of the American secret services. Let's remember the last FBI and NSA failures, such as failure to stop the Boston Marathon Bombings and so on. Our soldiers fight for America at the other end of the world and they deserve that their families should be kept safe."

The government spent more than $120 billion on the conflict in Vietnam from 1965-73 that led to the widespread inflation. Psychological effects were even deeper. The war had pierced the myth of American invincibility, and had bitterly divided the nation. Many returning veterans faced negative reactions from both opponents of the war and its supporters. In 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was created in Washington, D.C. There the names of 57,939 American armed forces killed or missing during the war are inscribes. Latter the total additions brought to 58,267."

        "text": "Nearly half of students don't speak English at GA elementary school A Georgia elementary school launched a new program for upcoming school year that will rely on students who just learned English to help teach younger students the language. Almost half of students are served in our program for English as a second language, so it will take years before some students master the language. Immigrants use every excuse why they can't learn: poverty, racism, too much homework, the list is endless. The main question is why do American taxpayers should pay and take responsibility to provide translators for folks who don't make an effort to learn and speak English? This is unfair that those kids whose parents chose to immigrate here (most illegally) are all on welfare. They know they don't have to work, because the government will take care of them. So, if the government continues to keep the same standards for illegal immigrants, America will become another 3rd world country."

Moreover, it looks like the government doesn't really care about lives of Americans. For the last decades America's \"leadership\" seem to be lackeys of corporations' interests.

        "text": "35,093 vets were left without medical assistance According to an internal document obtained by media, 35,093 combat veterans are being denied health care enrollment by the Department of Veterans Affairs because of a computer system error. The vast majority of these combat vets served in Afghanistan and Iraq. About 19,000 of them have been pending one month and five years and about 16,000 have been pending for more than five years. It is known that after five years vets lose their eligibility for free health care. Moreover approx. one-third of 847,000 vets with pending applications for health care had already died. Well, this story clearly demonstrates what value for the state the life of a man willing to sacrifice means. In fact the government doesn't care about its soldiers, even if they are heroes. This confirms that the government's slapdash attitude to the recording vets system left more than 35,000 veterans without medical assistance. And how many of them died before the error in the database was revealed! A truly disgusting attitude to our soldiers!"

I bet you remember the white former officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, last August? After national debate over the relationship between police and black communities Darren Wilson aka \"Bad cop, who killed innocent black child\" tried to go back to police work but was turned down because he's too big a liability. In the recent interview to New Yorker magazine he said, \"It's too hot an issue, so it makes me unemployable.\" So what does the situation mean to America? Almost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had the audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent. Michael Brown was a thug, who had just assaulted a store owner, and robbed him. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He must stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how upside-down society has become. I wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will surgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send teachers to jail for teaching? Instead hate Wilson, we should pray for him. He did nothing wrong but idiots turned society against an innocent man. So is it a new America?"

I'm so sick of this true Christians who have never taken the Bible in their hands. reading or listening someone who read ancient texts and then declaring them to be applicable to today violates the scriptures.

So they are forced to do whatever they can do to survive. This attack was fueled by transphobia and we do know that Amber's murder is the 12th murder of a transgender woman in the United States this year, and the 10th murder of a transgender woman of color. Transgender women, and especially transgender women of color, are disproportionately affected by violence. Her life was just beginning... I know that this loss will leave so many people with a hole in their lives and with more questions than answers.

They accused her of misconduct for having an expired tube of toothpaste and for brushing food off the table. They placed her in a solitary confinement \u2014 a torturous, extremely distressing experience. The whole cruel, corrupted system is against her. It looks like military prosecutors view Manning in a way that means she must be \"broken\" or forcefully assimilated because of her crime \u2014first, because she exposed the government's crimes, and government really doesn't like it, and second, because she's trans. Their goal is to see that Manning is as dehumanized as possible, but it's clear who the real non-humans are. Someone has gone to great lengths to paint Chelsea as a deceitful and psychotic character. But how many of those punishing Manning should themselves be in a psych ward? Transphobia is a one ugly thing. So sad when heroes like Chelsea Manning forced to suffer, to undergo injustice and humiliation, even though they had been through enough already! Free Chelsea Manning you sadistic creeps!! #ChelseaManning #FreeChelsea #transphobia #LGBT #transgender #PrideHeroes"

And of course this world always need an amazing power of woman's touch:-) Isn't it just amazing? Wonder Woman presides over the wedding of two brides in Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman, Chapter 48 written and illustrated by Jason Badower. Badower said he also really wanted to reference current affairs in the story - specifically, legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide. \"I saw this Wonder Woman story as an incredible opportunity to have one of the most recognizable, iconic characters in the world to be among the first to step forward and officially endorse this new law,\" he said. \"I thought, let's not just have Wonder Woman embrace this new law, let's have her celebrate it.\" Some may ask \u2014 why is it so important when superheroes depicted as supporters of marriage equality? Because it is a massive, land-mark milestone in LBGTQ rights history. Because the fight to get to normal was so difficult, and because the fight to change normal is still ongoing. Just like Wonder Woman using her superpowers to struggle with violence and injustice of the world! :-) #wonderwoman #superheroes #marriageequality #gaymarriage #lesbian"

The ceremony will mark the official reopening of the U.S. embassy along Havana's oceanfront promenade that overlooks the Florida Straits. `My inspiration is thinking about 90 miles separating the two countries and the two people, 90 miles is the sea between us.' Just 90 miles, but at the same time it is a vast schism that separates the United States from Cuba. The poet added he hopes there's still possible to achieve \"healing\" between the two countries. `This very moment, the negotiation of cultural identities... This just seems so surreal still... This is really in some sense just the beginning, the dawn of new things to come.' It would be so great if it will be indeed a new hope and a new day for Cuba, country which is still struggling to recover from severe embargo, country abused by wars. Sadly, the United States participated and initiated many of these conflicts... And there's more - severe economic crisis, socialist dictatorship of Cuban leaders. It's time for us to lend a helping hand. #RichardBlanco #Cuba #ForeignRelations #gay #queerart"

A Kentucky clerk who defied a federal judge's order to issue marriage licenses and turned away four gay couples has until Monday to convince the judge to delay his mandate. U.S. District Judge David L. Bunning rejected Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis' claim that her Christian faith should exempt her from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples and ordered her on Wednesday to hand out the licenses. But her office kept denying them. Interesting what would happen if I walked up to my boss and said I refuse to the job I am being paid for today? Let me think... guess I would stand in the unemployment line! Her job is not to participate in gay weddings!! All she has to do is confirm that the paperwork is correct! She should be fired, fined and charged with contempt of court!"

The 63-year-old comedian, who had struggled with depression, died by suicide on August 11 2014. His widow Susan Schneider said at the time of his death: \"As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.\" Even at home, Williams exhibited acceptance for the LGBT community with his trademark playfulness. While he denied rumours about being gay, he had no qualms about discussing the sexuality of his pet pug. He said: \"I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We're very modern.\" When the Westboro Baptist announced its intentions to picket his funeral, pro- LGBT organisation Planting Peace raised over $40,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital \u2014one of Williams' favourite charities. Robin Williams played many different roles in so many people's lives, and giving back to others was at the top of that list... We will never forget you. And we'll always love you..."

Coming out as transgender requires telling everyone in your life about you and enduring the consequences which often means the loss of family, lifelong friends, your job, and being the subject of ridicule, discrimination, and often violence. No one makes the decision easily and no one transitions unless they have to do so. Transphobic slur of stupid politicians like GOP presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee seeking to tremendous efforts of transgender community who are still struggle for equal rights. We know how easily bigots and fools who has power are able to reverse progressive changes for their own benefit. We can't let that happen! These people know what it means to be Transgender and know what it is to serve in our Armed Forces. We respect their opinion in both of these areas, especially over those of Governor Huckabee who has not experienced or accomplished either. #transgender #military #equality #transphobia #mikehackabee"
