This is how it looks like when A White Police kills a black Civiliian, and also feels it's his right to sue the dead because sympathizers gave him a sleepless night. If it was lawful to kill Quintonio LeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops, then we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always rewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and segregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of inhumanity. The cops still things it wasn't enough killing a mentally disordered and an innocent woman. He still has the balls to sue even the dead. This is what living in America is like, if you are black."
