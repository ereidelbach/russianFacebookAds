        "text": "The leader of radical religious group Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, announced that 20th anniversary Million Man March rally will take place on October 10, 2015 in Washington, D.C., at the National Mall. Organizers of the Million Man March call for justice, standing against the police and for blacks, Latinos and incarcerated. They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among radical groups. Only black activists say \"black lives matter\", forgetting the fact that justice is when all lives matter. Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should be imprisoned. Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's benevolent intentions. This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on American extremists to execute him. There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he should live here legally; he should not break the law. It's justice."

        "text": "The Justice Department is set to release about 6,000 inmates from federal prisons in a bid to reduce overcrowding. It is the largest one-time release of federal prisoners. The Department will release drug offenders who received harsh sentences over the last three decades. Every third of them is illegal immigrant. Barack Obama has criticized overblown sentencing laws that \"disproportionately impact communities of color.\" But is it indeed a reason to release criminals? If Latinos commit crimes often than whites, it doesn't mean that some Latino criminals should escape penalty."

So, Hillary Clinton said it's \"worth considering\" a nationwide gun ban and a \"buyback\" program to eradicate private gun ownership. Hillary says she is a democrat. Huh! No, she like Obama should say they're socialists who want to set up tyranny. The Founding Fathers had enough brains for preventing the situation when dictators run the country. They decided that armed nation is able to overthrow a tyrant. Maybe is it a true reason why Hillary Clinton stands against the Second Amendment?"
