The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame. This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions.

        "text": "Shocking video was captured by the police officer body cam. On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light. The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll down her window \"all the way\" to receive her ticket. When King refused, which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply citing her, the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground. When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police ends brutally for Black people and nothing seems to change. Video source @[540176322666035:274:P olice The Police]"
