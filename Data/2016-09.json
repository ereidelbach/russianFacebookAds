October 22nd is a day that people around the nation have mobilized every year since 1996 for a National Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a Generation. Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims and quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well- known case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man, who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot. We need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and serve! Not to kill, damage and cripple! Join us on October 22, in Charlotte, 600 East Trade Street, just between Charlotte City hall and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. National Day of Protest. Charlotte, NC"
