Your vote should be precious to y'all cus its your power to put another person in authority over you, your freedom, your daily life and your safety. To most people, it's about just going out to vote, if you did just that because you want to, well done, if you didn't, aka #BOYCOTT just like me, you also got your reasons. BUT, let those reasons be genuine! Let them be your reasons, not influenced upon or manipulated in any way. I'm proud of this mama not because she didn't vote #Hillary or #Trump, but simply because she did her research, decided for herself, in her interest and the interest of her kids, and voted consciously! I'm glad i choose not to be a part of this whole system. Im proud to be woke"

        "text": "CHARLESTON COP WHO FATALLY SHOT BLACK MAN ASKS JUDGE TO DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year- old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to drop murder charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the shooting. According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self- defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times, hitting Scott five times from behind. Slager's defense attorney's: \"The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split- second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.' The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire. We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay."

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley, who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars. When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting. After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and was pronounced dead. Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, \"It's Up to Us,\" she was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because ignoring it can take away years of people's lives. Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half of people shot by cops are mentally ill? Police officers are not equipped with firearms to deal with mental illness in the field. But they are equipped to protect us from criminals."

Kevin Campbell was driving his wife's minivan home in June when he was targeted for revenue collection by Allen Park Police Officer Daniel Mack. Mack literally kidnapped Campbell, placed him in handcuffs, threw him in a cage over a suspended license, accused Campbell of having drugs on him despite the fact that the K9 didn't find anything. Moreover, the cop sodomized him by putting the illegal substance inside his body. There was no search warrant."

The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between $65,000 and $75,000 per year. Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African- Americans. Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities. Find out how to escape bad credit reports: goo.gl/GArVbz"

        "text": "Joshua was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Indianapolis. Two months before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two sons. Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in Indianapolis at the age of 26. Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off- duty firefighter. The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said. Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her off \u2014 who she believed was a Chicago police officer \u2014 stopped and got out of their cars. At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley. She said the man got inside his car but exited again and \"he just started shooting,\" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal legally owned the gun and did not fire it. Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began shooting him. \"I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,\" said Boxley. Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year- old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother. \"This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They have no consideration for life,\" - Tiffaney Boxley. Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own death, armed or unarmed. #joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice"

I opted out of the elections and i had many Black people all up in my case, telling me how i was wrong and how i needed to make my vote count for Mrs. Clinton, all just to make sure Trump doesn't become president. Well now all i want to say is get over Trump and Clinton, they are rich white people, the elite who were born into and are a part of the system. I dream of liberation, not staying a slave under Hillary or Trump, so forget your childish rioting, no one has shot! #wakeup #organize ##joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice #november8 #elections2016 #black #melanin #blackisbeautiful #blacklivesmatter #blackgirlmagic #USA #blackandproud #democrat #republican #Africanamerican #unite4justice #vote #breakingnews"

According to a witness, the man who was arrested had originally been driving across the light rail tracks, when officers on foot attempted to stop his car, at which point, he drove off. He added that the man \"wasn't resisting at all until they tased him\" After tasing the man police officers used their elbows and fists, as the man lay on the ground, screaming for help. The man was heard screaming in pain: \"My fucking back is killing me! Oh god! My back!\" In a statement, released on November 2, Minneapolis Police Department confirmed the arrest, but said that a fuller video would show that the officers' conduct was justified."
