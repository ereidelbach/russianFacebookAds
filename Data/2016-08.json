        "text": "A demonstration which was held on Tuesday in response to the recent fatal police shooting of Philando Castile resulted in the arrest of 46 people outside the governor's mansion in St. Paul, Minnesota. Another arrest was carried out the following day, during the morning hours where 23 protestors were arrested and charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July 7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have been embarking on demonstration outside the governor's home but police officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there. Even though the street was cleared few days after July 18, some protesters have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

        "text": "Do you know that the white Milwuakee officer who was fired from his job after fatally shooting a mentally ill Black man in 2014 has gotten his job back? This is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black person's life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back \u2014 for the second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired. It is now absolutely clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

        "text": "Black people have no place in the coming 2016 presidential election because we have had our chance and we never profited out of it. We had a moment to present economic or social advancement plans to president Obama, yet we refused and let anti- blacks trick us into thinking that was not elected to benefit just black people alone. President Obama was elected for a reason. He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great. The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by day because those in position are descending from the ladder every day. In no time; \"White Power' will be stronger than before.

Hillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa Caucus. At the same time, she has already demonstrated that she prefers destroying the nation than losing election. She pledged not to deport illegal aliens. Moreover, it's known that Hillary is going to take in about one million Muslim refugees, if she is president. \"I'm telling you, Nov. 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us.\""
