After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in April 2014. The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned braids and twists amidst the criticism. Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight. Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks caused a lot of unnecessary stress. The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option. Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half- inch wide. Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have different hair texture."

        "text": "Drum and Spear Bookstore in Washington DC was opened by veteran members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee( SNCC) in summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company. One of co-founders said \"We don't define profit in terms of money. The profit is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to self-support.\" Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history, something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of the shop: the drum is for \"communications within the diaspora,\" and the spear symbolizes \"whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the people.\" The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice. This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores. Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a \"free spaces\" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear today, in 2017. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #drumandspear #blackpower"

She began to take him to local museums such as the Apex, the Sights and Sounds Black Cultural Museum and the Fernbank Museum of Natural History. To improve Leon's skills of painting he began to attend art classes of R. Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth Business Organization (SWAYBO) also helped Leon in many ways. According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of \"poise and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black community.\" Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book with his illustrations is As Big As God. That's what we call the support of family and the community! Good luck, Leon! We should believe in ourselves just like Leon's mother believed in him. Our roots are strong; just imagine how strong you can be if only you grow with your roots! #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #leonmoss #art #blackart"

Zendaya came across his comments on Twitter and decided to step in. \"Stumbling across this is stupid shit, she is fine as hell head to toe. [I] guarantee [she] doesn't know you exist my man. As for her, slay on queen,\" she tweeted and offered @_illestCee a modeling gig! \"I'm really speechless right now because becoming a plus size model has been my number one goal,\" the beauty replied. Black girl magic works! Don't try to mess with it! Especially when two black girls unite for a good purpose!

Education for the Black people was never easy, starting slave period when Black people could be killed for reading a book, including today when thousands of kids cannot get the education because of their skin color and the prejudice of the teachers, and this girl is proving that times are changing. Recently Black women were called the most educated group of people in the US and years by, we can see that those women are starting to make changes. Here and there we hear the news about Black people holding the positions for the first time in history and trust me, it's just a beginning! We are so happy to see the whole nation waking up and realizing the importance of both hustle and education."

Valdes created gorgeous gowns many stars like Mae West; Joyce Bryant, Josephine Baker, Gladys Knight, Sarah Vaughan, Dorothy Dandridge, Ella Fitzgerald and countless others. Although very little is known about her, Zelda Wynn also created costumes for the Dance Theater of Harlem and was a founding partner of the National Association of Fashion and Accessory Designers. #PanAfricanism #BlackNationalism #BlackEmpowerment #African Empowerment #AfricanAndProud #BlackAndProud #BlackPride #BlackPower #BlackLivesMatter #Amerikkka #UnapologeticallyBlack #UnapologeticallyAfrican #BlacklnAmerica #BlacklsBeautiful #KnowThySelf #KnowledgeOfSelf #KnowledgeOfS elfl sANationaIity #EconomicEmpowerment #Integration Failed #WhiteLiesMatter #Education #African Unification #AfricanUnity #BlackLove #JusticeOrElse #ProBlack #Regrann #blackexcellence #goals"

Currently a coalition of Native Americans appointed by to guide country's Indian policy is researching proposals to make energy development easier on tribal lands - including the idea of transferring them to private ownership. This way, big corporations finally won't be allowed to rob and destroy our lands. We are strong not only by our unparalleled unity, but also by our ability to see the bigger picture."

If most of the people going into the system are black men, most of my clients will be too.\" The Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy hosted a symposium Tuesday focusing on efforts to improve criminal justice and the American prison system. Titled \"Intersectionality and the Black Lives Matter Movement,\" the event featured a panel of speakers, including James Coleman, John S. Bradway professor of the practice of law, and Umar Muhammad, community organizer for the Southern Coalition for Justice, along with Theresa Newman, clinical professor of law. \"I didn't feel prepared for the world. I didn't feel rehabilitated. I had no resources,\" Muhammad said. -The Chronicle-"
