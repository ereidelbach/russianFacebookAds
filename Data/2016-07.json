A few days ago there were started the #MoveYourMany campaign which the main goal is to demonstrate the value of Black lives within America. At the request of rapper Killer Mike, over 8,000 people have transferred their money into Black-owned banks in the last 5 days. 50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. requested Blacks to replace their funds from non-Black banks to Black-owned institutions which would help to empower and advance Black community. The best way to fight the system is to break its capitalist back which is why it is important for Blacks to invest in ourselves!"

        "text": "A lone sniper shot 14 people and killed 5 police officers, in Dallas late Thursday night. It was a peaceful protest against the police shootings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. So he turned this peaceful protest into a scene of chaos and carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two civilians. The sniper, Micah X. Johnson was a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war. As he was captured, he claimed he wanted to \"kill white people\". There's no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There's no proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago and the police can't show anything to prove there was a link between Micah X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us time and again that \u00abblack lives matter terrorists are killing the police officers\u00bb. The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is a violent anti-government riot!

Most problems we face happen because we've stopped calling things by their names and the assassination of cops in Dallas was no exception. We're hiding behind political correctness and denying the truth because we don't want to \u0300 offend' someone. And the truth is: a group of people calling their supporters to commit violence is not a peaceful group. A group of people coming to their opponent's rallies and attacking peaceful people is a group of extremists. A group of people standing behind the attack on police is a group of terrorists. The Black Lives Matter are terrorists, and the sooner we admit it officially \u2014 the sooner this war on cops will end and people running a conservative rally won't be afraid to be attacked by a hateful gang.

In fact, the efficiency of our cops resulted in a decrease of the average amount of crimes, especially in large cities. Law-abiding citizens should never fear cops, but criminals do. And that's why Hillary is on the criminals' side. Join our rally on July, 23th in New York City, it's time to show Clinton that we will never let her become our next President!"

If you think it was just a coincidence, you make a mistake. Johnson got set up in one building and moved more than 10 miles away to another building owned by the same people to shoot from. It doesn't look like it is a coincidence. Moreover, some witnesses said that they saw Jonson visiting a mosque. Muslims seem to be not peace-loving as they say. And I don't want to see 10.000 potential terrorists here in Texas."

That's why we have to support all police officers who refused to applaud Obama. Taking sides with these rioters and racists, Obama literally called for open war against police officers and whites.

So, Bernie has the point. I appreciate the way he maintains his independent opinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the \"second Democratic option\". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than an \"organized crime\" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers' money! Hillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged feminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary has always been a \"defender\" of the minorities. So, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me. What's your opinion on that point?"

According to the newspapers, Lewis was wearing a shirt from the church when he opened fire, shouting a homophobic slur.
