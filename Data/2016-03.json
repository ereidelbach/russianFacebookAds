        "text": "IN 2016??? Closeted minor leaguer for St Louis Cardinals quit after coach and players spoke of killing gay people Tyler Dunnington was a 28th-round pick by the St Louis Cardinals in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft and given a chance to pursue his dream of being in the big leagues. But after just one season pitching for a Cardinals minor league team and performing solidly, Dunnington quit. He explains that during his playing days, he was a closeted gay man playing in an uncomfortable environment. A particular low point came when a coach made a bragging reference to the brutal murder in Wyoming of gay college student Matthew Shepard whose death led to federal hate crime legislation in the US. And the hate goes on and on and on. ...Y ou need fight back! It's a shame all those \"big strong men\" are afraid of what somebody does in private!!"

For the first time, LGBTQ groups included in NYC's St. Patrick's parade The nation's largest St. Patrick's Day parade kicked off Thursday in New York City, and for the first time in decades, gay activists are not decrying it as an exercise in exclusion. The first of roughly 200,000 marchers began striding up Fifth Avenue just after 11 a.m. in a procession of throbbing pipes and drums, smiling dignitaries and waving flags. Thank you!! Now we can come out of the closet and show you who we are! have a fundamental objection to creating divisions , groups , categories of citizens. Black, white, rich, poor, nationality and gender... Just be people!"

He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

        "text": "Robert Bentley, Alabama Governor, has decided to reform prison system. This is actually good news? Alabama happens to be one of the nation's poorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison. The prison system houses 24,000 inmates but it was designed for 13,000.Let me enlighten you a little on how it's going to be done. Four other larger prisons will be built additionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have taught of using this money for projects like health care facilities and other, he chose prisons. It's not bad though, at least inmates will have free live behind bars. It shows how much he cares for his people.

        "text": "Expecting mother includes late husband in maternity photo shoot Through the struggles and pains of losing a dear husband. Nicole Bennett has built courage to take maternity photos with her 4-year-old son. She added old photos of late husband Deonta, but they were slightly faded to appear as a spirit \u2014 a symbol of hope that he watches over them. She also did this as a memorial for her unborn daughter who is due March 25. We commend her for her boldness and we hope that she finds solace in these photos. #NicoleBernett #Maternityphotoswithlatehusband"

Freeing himself from emotional trauma, Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them. Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American police find interest in \u2014 unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks. Very ridiculous.

        "text": "A 21-year-old Oklahoma man was sentenced on Monday to 40 years in prison for sexually assaulting orphaned children while on a missionary trip in Kenya in 2014. Matthew works at an orphanage built and run by an American citizen named Upendo Children Centre. The main aim of this orphanage was to assist abandoned children in Nairobi, Kenya. Upon Matthew's arrival in Kenya, he insisted on not staying in the apartment allocated to him by authorities but preferred to stay in the very dormitory where these children stayed. He also based his choice on being in a better position to assist the children should the need arise. Mathew raped three teenagers \u2014 ages of 5, 9, and 15 respectively for not less than 8 times. He also maltreated a 12 year old boy. This outrageous act led to his sentence of 40 years imprisonment and a fined of $15, 863."

        "text": "It is so disheartening knowing that people are put behind bars because they failed to settle a fine. Most people are jailed because one way or the other there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even though they were innocent. Prosecutors have developed this platform as a gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from civilians. You can be put behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one's life becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all these people who take advantages of people by making them pay huge sums of money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn't pay a fine.

He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

She said there is \"a special place in hell\" for people like Hillary \"and I hope she enjoys it there\". Smith added in her interview: \"I want Hillary to talk to me personally, and tell me why there was no security there, when they were asked for it. I know this, because I spoke to my son. That day, he says he was really scared, because he saw the 17 people \u2014 17 November, whatever it was, that they were walking around taking pictures. And he was afraid. He says it didn't look very good. And he was afraid. And that he asked for security, and he was turned down.\" This must be a mean joke we're having that kind of liar as a possible president. Even understanding that most liberals are brainwashed I just don't get it - how can a politician caught in a lie of that scale still be trusted by electorate? One must be totally insane to follow THAT kind of leader. Patricia's son is an American hero and his blood is on Hillary's hands."

        "text": "The liberal mass media tried to overblow a story about the KKK's endorsement of Trump. They claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and \"white supremacists\". The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared \"I don't know anything about David Duke... You're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking people I know nothing about.\" However, \"for some reasons\" the same mass media in their revelation campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton's ties to Robert Byrd, a former KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of \"surpassing eloquence and nobility\". In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying \"It is almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd. He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a government that improves the lives of the people it serves.\" So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate can't be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that. Isn't that a little hypocritical?"

        "text": "Hillary Clinton made new promises to extend our traitor President Obama's pro-immigration policy. She also promised to offer illegals residency and \"a path of citizenship\". During the debate on 8th March she was asked about deportation. Clinton said: \"I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That's a relatively small universe.\" Oh wonderful, so she admits she wants to be the second Obama, like the first one isn't enough. And we know what's behind this world \"children\" \u2014 young men who claim to be less than 18. Same way the \"illegals without a criminal record\" is also those who are not proved to be criminals yet. Crossing the U.S. border without permission is already a crime. A crime that should bring just one simple punishment \u2014 deportation and a prohibition of further entrance. We do not need a president who doesn't understand that. We do not need a president who forgives this kind of crime. We do not need Hillary."

After attacks in Benghazi, after her actions and lies caused a national scandal, after officially being caught on lies she afforded herself to make a statement \"I've said Iraq was a mistake. Libya was a different kind of calculation. And we didn't lose a single person.\" More than three years passed after the accident and still Clinton didn't even contact Benghazi victims' families. She didn't even try to ask for excuse, like those murdered Americans don't even exist. We definitely don't need a President who lies without a twinge of conscience. Luckily most Americans won't trust such an obvious liar."

        "text": "Religious leaders joined local organizations in rallying support for two men who said they were attacked outside a convenience store this weekend in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime. Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which occurred shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21 st St. That's just northeast of the Wichita State University campus. One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is a 19-year-old student who has chosen to remain anonymous. They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas money. When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him for money, one of the students attempted to intervene. The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who had gotten out of the car. The suspect called his friend \"brown trash\" and told him he had to \"leave this country,\" According to Usama's account, his friend responded: \"This is my country. Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?\" The incident \"escalated really quick,\" with the suspect attempting to punch his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said he was assaulted and knocked down. He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode circles around the two students, chanting \"Trump! Trump! Trump!\" and screaming, \"We'll make America great again! We'll throw you out of the wall!\""

We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential campaign, but did you support us before campaign? We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women and children, to die in their homes, and for what? Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AI- Gaddafi. You said in an interview: \"We came, we saw, he died\". Let's not forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security, and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were also injured in the attacks. You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat not only to the U.S. but the whole world! You are supporting gun control, disarming the American citizens and at the same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders, creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. 8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You change your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry, but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United States. Sincerely, United Muslims of America"

In an America where the Republican political party had a 44% very unfavorable view of Islam, despite 78% of the same Republican respondents saying they neither worked with nor had any Muslim friends. according to a YouGov poll conducted from 6 -9 March, 2015. In an America where failed businessman and top contender for the GOP nomination Donald Trump has publicly and unapologetically called for widespread surveillance on mosques, mass deportations, denial of asylum to all Muslims and has lauded a plan to shoot Muslims with bullets covered in pigs blood. So when Bernie Sanders acts like a human being and commits his prospective presidency (not to mention entire career) to combatting racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that Muslim Americans overwhelmingly support his bid for the White House."

In 1970, Rice was one of the two officers who were charged for the murder of Omaha police officer, Larry Minard. Authorities claim they coaxed Larry to a house with a 911 call, and then detonated a homemade bomb that killed him. He was the seventh-longest-serving inmate in Nebraska. Subsequent paroles and retrials were denied for these two men. Langa was in prison for 45 years. Details of the cause of his death are still unknown.
