        "text": "The US-led coalition strike in Syria's Raqqa province killed 12 women, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said this morning. The second coalition strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more civilians. Just to make it clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this is more and more civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%. However, terrorists weren't destroyed in '30 days' and it seems like they won't be destroyed in the closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war 'for freedom', it's another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood money is the main goal of it. For America, another continuous military conflict can lead to a financial crisis, this is exactly what happened in 2008."

That's why the US often offers Mexicans to join the armed forces, in exchange for what they promise to give American citizenship. In this regard, Mexicans are often sent to the war zone in Syria or other countries, from where they sometimes do not return. Many Mexicans have to go for it, as today the process of obtaining American citizenship can last for years and even dozens of years. The US policy towards Mexicans is becoming increasingly brutal, therefore, it is necessary to stop any attempts by the US government to send Mexicans to the war zones, where they fight for any unknown goals."

On April 16 Plummer, his mother, and his 14-year-old little brother did not see the police lights because the unit was parked down the road. Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his Grandfather's shotgun that was given to his mother for protection. When Plummer went to the door, the scared kid fired a warning shot to fend off the would-be burglars. However, the shotgun blast hit one officer in the arm and the other in the face.

        "text": "I believe Ron Paul's position on our foreign military policy is absolutely right. After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end Obama's policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas. \"We're not going into Syria\", Trump said it to calm down those who got really concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war. Here's what Ron Paul thinks about it: \"By the end of this month, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send his national security team back to the drawing board \u2014 or replace them. There is no way another \"surge\" in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria) puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will succeed any better than it did the last time.\" Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We've started the whole Afghanistan thing to beat the Soviets, and no there's no Soviet Union on the world map, and all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian students."

        "text": "The Obama Administration turned a great idea of fighting terrorism into drawing our country into another regime change venture. Our military presence in Syria now doesn't serve American interests. Our soldiers are there to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for Americans. And that's why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly opposite to the \"America First\" concept. I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he's trying make a deal out of it, but there's one important thing here: under no circumstances can our soldiers' lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential campaign Trump said \"let's bring back our soldiers home\", and now it's really time to do it. This is not our war."

We could have solved thousands of economic and security problems by simply rejecting the aggressive military policy we've been having for so long. Iraq war didn't end terrorism, and didn't solve the Islamization problem. If we repeat the same war in Syria, we'll only get the same result: no profit for American citizens and several thousands of dead American soldiers. Globalists, terrorists and Corporations are the only ones who benefit from oil wars."

        "text": "Our politicians should never forget that. We've been watching our military commandership wasting lives of American soldiers for too long, let's hope it will end now when Trump is in charge. A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa. We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all. Unfortunately that's hardly possible because of the corruption in the Government. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator McCain, and that's why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but also getting involved into another regime change venture and possibly another oil war. We're fighting radical Islamists, but we're also siding with Syrian opposition, the very same radical Islamists, and there's absolutely no guarantee that these rebels won't replace ISIS when it's gone. There's only one chance to avoid another Iraq: Trump and the American nation must defeat globalist politicians and the Establishment. All we can do now is to pray for all American soldiers to return back home alive and safe."

For all the families who were forced out of their homes, for the mothers who had to watch their sons and daughters suffering, for the children who are now orphans because of this terrible wicked war. Words can't heal their pain; our tears won't bring back those who left us already; nothing can console our grief right now. However, we have the duty to save those whose lives are still at risk. For the sake of these people, we have to work to end this terrible war. Unfortunately, we haven't seen much development in this direction. Bombing random targets and going for momentary aims, taking reckless decisions and shifting our focus off crushing terrorists only leads to more casualties among civilians and creates even more suffering. We have to stick to our agenda and work to protect people, launching additional missiles on them won't help. Pray for peace to return to Syria and work sanely to bring this moment closer!"

Unfortunately, many of these hypocrites have infiltrated the American establishment. Such people benefit from regional conflicts and war is nothing more than business for them. It was these people who launched the missiles that never hit no terrorists but led to civilian casualties. It is them who keep receiving money from the same actors who sponsor ISIS and other groups. These people want more American involvement because it means more money for them and they don't care about the terrorists. In fact, radicals really help them increase their bloody income. The only way to resist the corrupt elites is to oppose military actions with no particular aim and promote anti-terrorist agenda! Focus on what's truly important and we will end the war in Syria sooner than you can imagine."

        "text": "New administration's budget proposal to Congress includes $1.7 trillion in mandatory spending cuts over 10 years, including $800 billion from Medicaid and $193 billion from food stamps. At the same time, this proposal, called \"A New Foundation for American Greatness\", includes a boost in military spending and $1.6 billion for the construction of the border wall with Mexico. To be honest, I'm not sure, that the wall and another pointless war, instead of affordable health care and help for those in need, is what we have to keep our focus on. It seems like republicans are using every single possibility to get more money for their wars, and they don't mind it if average Americans live in poverty or without affordable medicine. Why additional billions to Military? Our Department of Defense budget is already bigger than military budgets of the next eight countries combined, isn't it enough? Here is what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: \"Based on what we know about this budget, the good news -- the only good news -- is that it's likely to be roundly rejected by members of both parties here in the Senate \u2014 just as the last budget was\""

        "text": "The administration is requesting a $54 billion increase in military spending for 2018. Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of 2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31%  cut in the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high- powerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative energy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use every opportunity to start another war, they are acting the same way in Syria. Start thinking!"

He said that sending troops to Syria was a very difficult decision, but not bombing Syria was even harder to make. Obama was hated for not taking actions, but it's better for being hated for not killing innocent people that for starting a useless war. Though it was tough, Obama did a great job keeping away from the war that would take millions from the US budget and get innocent people killed. Unfortunately, the recent government didn't think twice, before they started bombing Syria. They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill innocent kids in Syria. How did we come to this?!"
