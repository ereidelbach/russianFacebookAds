Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would be exposed to, and of their need of protection. And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends."

Sarah and her partner Kyle Harris created a movie about the journey called \"The Water Gap: Return to the Homelands\" which already won the award at the Native American Film Festival of the Southeast. Propaganda of native culture and traditions is one of most powerful weapons in Native American fight for their rights. People have always tried to destroy things they don't understand. And white people never understood native culture properly. Many teens who had native ancestors deep in the past know nothing about their culture. Films, journeys, even videos on Youtube, can help."
