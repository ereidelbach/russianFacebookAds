        "text": "SCOTUS RULES AGAINST KENTUCKY CLERK IN GAY MARRIAGE CASE The Supreme Court on Monday evening denied a Kentucky clerk's request to keep enforcing her \"no marriage licenses\" policy \u2014 an attempt to avoid issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples \u2014 while she appeals the trial court's preliminary ruling. Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to choose whether to issue marriage licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled off to jail. For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable. She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she's screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite! And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's her role only to enact it! Funny how all these \"Christians\" are preaching and practicing all this hate, eh? If Jesus were around today, his response would be most likely, \"What the hell is wrong with you people!\" #SameSexMarriage #MarriageEquality #Kentucky #SCOTUS #homophobia #bigotry"

        "text": "Barack Obama and his team have spent two months working to secure 41 percent for Iran deal. And now they claim enourmous victory. Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect \u2014 a legally binding long- term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed. Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in 2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama. But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a subject to a vote \u2014 not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his presidential veto. The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to overturn such a veto \u2014 and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So, instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67 senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to support the deal. Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42 percent. Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions."

First, the 2nd amendment makes people less prone to crimes. Most of people will not attack others, if they have a chance to be shot. Moreover, armed citizens help to prevent some crimes. Second, the 2nd amendment gives equal odds for criminals and people who have no negative intentions. They both have firearms. Third, gun owners as usual feel a responsibility, it makes them law-abiding citizens. Of course, every rule has an exception. However, you see, the 2nd amendment has enormous advantages."

And it may be assumed they were smarter than many liberals. The second amendment is deterrent. If a criminal knows you have a gun, he doesn't want to rob you. Of course, not all Americans have a gun, but criminals don't know who is unarmed. Liberals can say that guns increase crime rate. In fact, it is nonsense. Look at statistics: the most gun-friendly state is Wyoming, and it has low crime-rate. The states with high crime rate are states where there are many illegals as usual. So, liberal hysteria is just foolishness. Liberals find reasons of crimes in wrong places. The U.S. Constitution should be saved. Do you agree?"

If the government gives an amnesty to them who broke the immigration law, it doesn't respect Americans who love their country. Why citizens cannot break the law, but illegals can? What nonsense! Illegal immigrants work illegally and they don't pay taxes. Many of them commit a crime. And the police have no their finger prints because illegals have never obtained U.S. visa. If people want to live in the United States, they should require U.S. residence permit. Illegals should not be amnestied. How can we be the greatest nation in the world, if we don't respect our law?

Since then the U.S. Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times. All of amendments are steps that made the United States the greatest country in the world. The U.S. Constitution is not only the law, it is the basis of the country. Every true patriot respects it. Unfortunately, last decade has become the time of nihilism. More and more people don't respect American law. More and more people come to the United States and some of them don't feel reverence for our Constitution. It goes without saying that illegals who already broke the immigration law and will violate the supreme law easily. But the worst thing is that the current president of the United States and some high-ranking officials also spit upon the Constitution. They call for ban the right to bear arms, a confederate flag (I think this flag reflects not slavery, but important part of American history) and some liberals ban even the Old Glory -- a school district in Tennessee has banned all flags and banners, including the U.S. flag -- and so on. The same regards the Iran deal. America has a hard time. And we have to save the U.S. Constitution. We have to do it in God's name! America has to be great again because we are one nation under God!"

But the gang of anarchist thugs declared war against the police. I can't belive it's possible. The police administer the law. Law-abidingness is an important part of American life. Of course, history knows police mistakes, but a mistaken arrest is very rare occurance. At the same time, don't forget that officers risk their lives every day. Americans have to honor sacrifices of policemen. Police officers significantly improve the quality of life for the citizens of their communities by keeping the peace despite sometimes overwhelming odds. America has to stand against radical activists who threaten not only officers lives, but also our security."

The tragedy of September 11th is still touching us. Some of us lost our family members or our friends, while others saw the terrorist attacks firsthand. R.I.P to all innocent victims, workers, police officers, firefighters and even dogs that died in this tragedy. This is a day in our history that everyone is going to remember. Today we should honor the memory of the killed ones and share our stories. What were you doing on 9/11? I'd like to tell you #My911 Story. I was only 15 when the attacks occurred. I was at school. I remember that somebody came and told us that there had been a serious bombing in NYC. We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom called me crying. School was letting out early that day. When I came home I remember my dad watching the news and telling me that terrorists took responsibility for the attacks. And do you remember what you were doing on 9/11? #My911 Story"

        "text": "Vatican Says Transgender Man Cannot Become A Godparent The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying out the task. Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the bishop of his local diocese on Spain's southern coast questioned his gender identity. Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery. Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family's request to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote to the Vatican for advice. Zornoza published the Vatican's reasoning for rejecting Salinas' wish. It said transsexual behavior \"reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one's own sexuality.\" The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time, the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just another superstition of Church. Funny."

        "text": "Gay the force be with you: Star Wars soldier comes out Hero soldier Sinjir Rath Velus comes out in a new novel, which is part of the smash hit sci-fi franchise with arch-baddie Darth Vader. The space warrior appears in Star Wars: Aftermath, which bridges the gap between Return of the Jedi and new film The Force Awakens. Sinjir, an Imperial turncoat who now serves in Luke Skywalker's Rebellion, is the first major gay role to be part of the Star Wars universe. He reveals his sexuality to female bounty hunter Jas Emari, who tries to chat him up. Chuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: \"I don't think his sexuality needs to be this giant plot point. At the same time, it's part of who he is. Isn't that great, guys? Ain't no lie, It's a big step forward. We want to thank the creators of the new \"Star Wars\" for the incredible courage and opposition to conservative bias in Hollywood cinema. There should be a special organization in Hollywood that will protect the rights of gay actors. There should be at least one gay character in every movie in order to help the American society get rid of homophobic stereotypes."
