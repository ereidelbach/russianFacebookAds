        "text": "ANOTHER BLACK MAN MURDERED IN POLICE CUSTODY. THINGS HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he had a \u00b0medical episode' at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest. On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas, was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail inmate. Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were followed. We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after \"fighting\" with the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in police custody."

That's why we ask you to do the same and send your photos to us. Why? Because we want to live in a better future and Hillary is not the person who will help us in getting justice and peace by all means! Dear followers, if you agree, just don't be ignorant to your future in America, join our flashmob and take a photo with #HillaryClintonForPrison2016 or #nohillary2016 and tag @blackmattersus!? Looking forward to your photos?? BlackMattersUS AmericanCops"

Jermaine Walker was arrested and sent to prison after the police officers and a state's attorney investigator had LIED UNDER OATH. They said that there was no surveillance camera in the alley where they arrested him ; even though it was and Walker said that! It's another prove that if you are black in this country; you are never safe. You can be arrested killed or imprison literally for the color of your skin. Walker's attorney said that Walker can obtain up to $170,000 for the time he spent in prison, but is it a good price for the 10 years of his life?! These bastards ruined this man's life and proved once again that there is not justice in this country!"

For example, Wisconsin suspended 26.6 percent of Black students compared to the 3 percent of white students. Also in Minnesota, Connecticut, Iowa and Nebraska black students were six times more likely than white students to be suspended from school. The racism in education is the reason why the school-to-prison pipeline exists. Our kids cannot even get a proper education, no wonder the success rate among black students is low. Somehow white people still think that education is only their privilege."

She was shot by the cop while she slept on a couch during a botched raid. The killer is still employed by the Detroit Police Department. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter and two lesser charges in her death, but the case was dropped in January 2015. Justice hasn't been served for Aiyana and her grieving family. We're planning a peaceful rally in front of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center on May 21 to honor the memory of Aiyana and other victims of police violence and demand demilitarization of police. We should draw as much attention as possible to the lack of justice for the families of those who lost their beloved ones at the hands of the police. Invite everyone you know and join us on May 21. We should stand up for the better future of our kids! The 6th Anniversary Of The Aiyana Jones' Death"

She gets hundreds of flirty messages every day and she laughs at the idea that changes someone's sexuality. Roby Rose thinks that it's not possible to change someone's sexuality because it's something you're born with and it's not changeable. I agree with her! Unfortunately, bigots like to say that homosexuality is a choice, so it can be \"cured\". Just like Ben Carson thinks that you're choosing to be gay and the prison is the proof of that. These ideas lead to thousands of broken lives. Why is it so hard to accept the fact that we were born this way?!"
