She became the wife of a Prince and started a dynasty that extends into many of today's Xhosa royal families. Due to her recessive gene, now and then a child is born in the area with bright blue eyes. This is fascinating! This is a pure luck for a Black girl to be adopted and loved after being thrown to the sea. I guess she deserved to be a queen after what she had experienced. Black people are the best of the best and I'm proud to be Black! #Blackprideus #black #blacklove #african #africanamerican #blacklivesmatter #icantbreathe #blackpride #blackandproud black priiide Yoyoyoyoyoy"

Can you imagine that a group of armed men took over a federal property and have vowed to kill if they are forced to leave there unless the government change the law in their favor. Nonsense! The ongoing Oregon standoff has taught us is that it's never been more apparent that the U.S. government values white lives above all others. The most stark example is comparing the kid-gloves treatment the white gunmen in Oregon are getting with the 1985 bombing of the MOVE house in Philadelphia. #GunmeninOregon #TheMove #1985Bombing"

In addition, more than half of the US's governors have said they will no longer provide placement for Syrian refugees, arguing that they pose too great a risk to national security. New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie has said his state will not take in any refugees \u2014 \"not even orphans under the age of five\". Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has said he has directed state police to \"track\" the Syrian refugees in his state, something his state police have played down. GOP presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush have suggested the US government prioritize Christian refugees. Barack Obama has pledged to veto the legislation, and has condemned the anti-refugee comments as \"un-American\", but experts worry the backlash could have dangerous consequences if these claims go unchecked. The stories you need to read, in one handy email Read more \"Sowing fear of refugees is exactly the kind of response groups like Isis are seeking,\" said lain Levine, deputy executive director for program at Human Rights Watch, on Thursday. \"Yes, governments need to bring order to refugee processing and weed out militant extremists, but now more than ever they also need to stand with people uprooted from their homes by ideologies of hatred and help them find real protection.\" http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-america- fact-from-fiction-congress Obama has condemned more than half of the US's governors as \u0300un-American' for saying they will no longer provide placement for Syrian refugees.

Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all these SJWs, let's refer to racial discrimination in the army of Union. A black soldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance. Almost a twofold difference! How tolerant tho! And what was going on in the \"racist\" Confederate States Army? Every soldier was paid $11/month until 1864 regardless of his skin color.
