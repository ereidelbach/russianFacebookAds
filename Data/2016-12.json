But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating to the Black Youth Project 100. Kaepernick donated to the Chicago chapter of the organization toward \"Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to Build Black Futures\" which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States of America. \"I'll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those communities,\" he said. When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don't really care about haters. Good job, Colin."

Often times, we overlook our own businesses to purchase products and services from businesses outside of our communities. Many of us have heard the disturbing statistic about a dollar circulating within the black community for only 6 hours compared to approximately 2-4 weeks in white, Jewish, and Asian communities. If we don't support our entrepreneurs, how can we expect others to support our amazing businesses? We must continue to educate and change the mindset of consumers so \"buying black\" becomes the norm amongst our people and not only an encouragement during the holiday season,\" said Lonzell Fogle and Breyon Williams, founders of My Suited Life."

Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe Street that's being displaced by development says he's doing it to make a statement. \"It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something that's not done here by black folk. said Joseph Wicks; who now owns the house at 33 Woolfe St. \u0300 None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted toward black folk.\" Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most. The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it cant be torn down! I'm so proud of this man! He is making a real movement! Actions like this can protect our history!"

Manville continued to study while incarcerated and eventually earned two college degrees during his sentence. He became enamored with the legal profession and went to law school right after his parole. He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards, Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented various inmates and prison guards in civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches law at Michigan State University, where he hopes the insights he shares with students inspire them to someday help improve the system as well. \u2014ListVerse-r"

As a teenager, Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles. By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for cooking, while he was on kitchen duty. He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some of LA's top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land a job at Caesar's Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All the fame and success hasn't gotten to Henderson's head though and he has continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can achieve in life with the right choices."
