The two recent U.S. wars were costly for our nation; to put it lightly. They led to domestic devastation of country. No matter what Defense Secretary or POTUS are saying they don't fool me with promises of gay military equality as key to the nation's agenda. Better talk to me about cutting DoD's budget.

Moreover she claimed that she is \"almost to the point\" of defending the segregation. After her post about the recent pool party incident drew local attention, the teacher deleted her profile. \"This makes me ANGRY! This officer should not have had to resign. I'm going to just go ahead and say it....the blacks are the ones causing the problems and this \u0300 racial tension. I guess that's what happens when you flunk out of school and have no education. I'm sure their parents are just as guilty for not knowing what their kids were doing; or knew it and didn't care,\" she wrote. She also added,\"I'm almost to the point of wanting them all segregated on one side of town so they can hurt each other and leave the innocent people alone. Maybe the 50s and 60s were really on to something. Now, let the bashing of my true and honest opinion begin ....G O!# imnotracist #imsickofthemcausingtrouble #itwasagatedcommunity\". As we see Karen Fitzgibbons is a real racist, who approves the humiliation of black people! This news clearly reflects that American society is close to collapse, if not to say to war. As the authorities are doing nothing to resolve the situation, in the near future we may face real race war within our country."

        "Ad Text": "A woman pretended Afro-American to gain control over black community association The president of a local NAACP chapter in Spokane, Washington is under investigation after her parents publicly accused her of lying being African American. Both parents of Rachel Dolezal are white. Rachel Dolezal also serves as the chair of Spokane's Office of Police Ombudsman Commission and is an adjunct professor of Africana Studies at Eastern Washington University. Dolezal falsely identified herself as African-American in order to be appointed as a chair. Dolezal's parents paid attention to the official documents, including a birth certificate, confirming that Rachel is part Swedish, Czech, and German with \"traces\" of Native American heritage. We see, how whites are trying to gain control over traditionally black organization that protects the rights and interests of the black community. In the Dolezal's case it is unlikely it was a mistake or personally motivated fraud. Simply she was given a task to join the association of black community in order to control it and hold the interests of white majority. We need a deep inspection of Rachel Dolezal's activities while she was a president of the local branch of the Association of black people! In order not to repeat similar cases in future we need a careful control of all appointments by black community! As it is, there is a dominance of whites in police departments and authorities of cities with a predominantly black population!"

His revolutionary knowledge mixed with street experience made him powerful unstoppable force that spoke to the hearts of millions of people. His songs touch on a number of engaging topics, including religion, women, oppression, etc. 2Pac was a humanitarian, who stood up for those who couldn't stand up for themselves. He believed in Fight and Speaking the Truth. Nowadays a lot of singers, both black and white use their music to sell records, just for making money. American society at all levels became too corruptive, starting from our government and ending with ordinary citizens. On the contrary Tupac did his music to influence the world. That's why he spoke to issues of poverty, oppression and racism. Today young African-Americans have fallen under bad influence of money, drugs and so on. Yeah, it is all started from the government's attitude towards Blacks. But let's remember Tupac and his ability to question the social order. Changes, one of his popular songs, asks everyone to change their lifestyles for better society. He always asked people to share with each other and to learn to love each other."

A young man from Georgia was shot to death at a pool party at Fayette. It was an advertised on social 200 teenager's pool party which ended up with shootings of unknown assailant for unknown reasons. One of the five injured, a 19-year-old black teenager Clanton passed away on the way to hospital. In fact, the media has not made a transparent effort to cover up the incident. Why the pool party in Georgia is a silent story? Why the police was not aware of a large party? Why this story has no national outrage? Is it ok when a black teenager dies? Unfortunately, the responding police officers were not able to prevent the tragedy. From these facts one might conclude, police officers know the easiest ways to arrest people, but they are irresponsible to avoid the shootings at the average pool party."

Witnesses reported that the cop tried to force them to delete videos from their phones. Videos show how the child writhes in agony from being tased. Police said that the child ran away from home and was missing for a day-and-half. However it doesn't give the reason to taser a child. We see another case of police misconduct, when the policeman actually attacked the child. This case should reach the court, because the child hasn't done anything unlawful. The policeman exceeded his powers and used force against a child. So he should be punished. Before the trial nothing's gonna change and cops are about to do whatever they want. The task of all Americans who have witnessed police brutality is to extend all the information about it in order to reach out the government and the court."

Since January 1, 2015 at least 508 people have now been killed by policemen. Moreover, analyzing all deaths caused by police, African-American and Hispanic people are more likely to be killed than Whites. Figures show that the index of deaths for black people is 3.45 per million, while for whites it is 1.26 per million. Add here military-style equipment and non-lethal weapons, given to cops. And only 0.02 per cent of the nation's police forces are investigated each year. Only 0.02! That means, US policemen are immune from criminal changes in their killings. That's why they carry out their daily police raids to destroy the population at the territories under their control."

The young clean-shaved shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people. Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be investigated as hate crime. Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes? What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore? #CharlestonShooting #chsnews"

According to the family's testimony, Krystal Dixon and her sister Maya Dixon took their eight children, nephews and nieces to Ohio public school in a Fairfield. Nevertheless, the pool employee demanded the family to leave due to one of the children did not have swim trunks. One of the boys broke the rules and the staff asked the family to leave. As six-months pregnant Krystal Dixon walked to the parking lot, the police officer grabbed her arm and asked for an ID-card. The witness video shows how the police officer pepper sprayed Dixon's family and grabbed 12-year-old child by neck. But according to the Fairfield police department, the white police officer did not use excessive force. Did the pool staff force them to leave because they were black? Was it a race factor? Don't you think the police officer's attempt to arrest Krystal Dixon was unlawful? How the police officers should be charged? What kind of right of defense do you have against unlawful arrests? These days, there is far more to being a \"good cop\" than choosing not to hurt innocent people. Plus, when are we going to stop being stereotypical? Even today, the stereotypes effect black population of the United States of America transmitted through music, lyrics, titles, literature, movies and folk saying. White Americans across the country embrace African-Americans the image of criminals and looters. How are we going to live with that?"

Church opened its doors for the first service following the killing of nine of its congregants Wednesday, thousands in Charleston took to the streets in a show of support and solidarity. Observers on the bridge, and thousands more at the base, joined hands to create a \"unity chain,\" then held a moment of silence that lasted five minutes in honor of the fallen. Police estimated that 10,000 to 15,000 took part in Sunday's gathering, according to the Post and Courier. Cars drove slowly past the bridge, taking in the sight and honking horns in solidarity as people chanted \"Charleston strong!\" Throughout history people start to unite only when they face danger or when they're in times of great sorrow. Modern America is accustomed to meet only imaginary dangers, however, Americans are getting more and more reasons to sorrow over something day by day. Does it mean that the key to the unity of 330 million Americans is constant fear and unending sorrow? Does it mean that only this can make Americans unite and forget about the infighting and differences? Unfortunately, yes, it does."

Today, we ask to remove this symbol of racism that flies 120 miles away from the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. Yes, we must wipe off every single symbol of racism from the United States of America including the confederate flag, KKK and other racist organizations. We must give new names to the streets which were named after racist political figures and slave traders. We must remove monuments dedicated to Andrew Jackson, Robert Lee, Benjamin Huger, James Longstreet who owned slaves on their farms. How can we ever expect to get the racist symbols removed until we show ourselves to be men the same as any other race of men?"

West criticized Obama as \"a person who is afraid and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy.\" \"A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and fighting against white supremacy,\" West explained. \"So when many of us said we have to fight against racism, what were we told? 'No, he can't deal with racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president of all America, not just black America.' We know he's president of all America but white supremacy is American as cherry pie.\" West is right as usual. African minorities would choose Mr. West in 2009 and 2012 instead of Obama. But we had no choice. Cornel is a good leader, he knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks from police pressure, never tried to stop police violence against blacks. Just count how many black lives were destroyed during his presidency. The number is horrific."

The autopsy report suggested that Gray may have attempted to stand up during the van ride, and that the injury could have occurred as he was thrown against the van wall when the vehicle changed direction. Like really? When police took Gray to the hospital, doctors determined that he had sustained a severed spine and crushed voice box. High-energy injury? We don't think so. It's hard to believe. Do they think we're idiots or something? Cops imprison you, shoot you, sever your spine, crush your larynx, send you to war, keep you poor, call you a thug and get away with it. There's no excuse for what happened to Freddie."

His party grew up to a size of 5,000 full time party workers in 45 branches across America and inspired generation in North America to join the struggle against oppression.

The criminal justice system is very important institution where law enforcement investigate a crime gathering evidences to identify the presumed perpetrator ensuring that rights of the convicted are respected. But what if American criminal justice reform outdated and the country need to focus on a renewed sense of justice? What if disproportionate punishment is the main challenge of the criminal justice system? Disproportionate punishments known far and wide across the United States of America. Consequently, the victim's skin color plays a crucial role in deciding what kind of punishment he will receive. For instance, you are more likely to be sentenced to death if you have killed a white person. Frankly speaking, if the government wants to keep the country away from the summer urban riots, then they must think about the living standards of black population that is several times below the living standards of white people in America. In addition, the White House must reduce the unemployment rates of black population by revising the hiring policy for black Americans.T herefore, if we want a life's balance, the government have to reconsider all these things, because Black Americans lives matter."

        "Ad Text": "Sadness and shocking tragedy at historically black church in Charlestone A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other church members at black church in Charlestone, S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people. Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be investigated as hate crime. Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes? What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore?"

It's strange to hear it from the man who supported 2nd amendment earlier. The lack of clear-cut opinion is very bad character trait. However, it doesn't matter. The right to bear arms is inalienable right of Americans that was given us by the Founding Fathers. The 2nd amendment guarantees private safety of the people. The right to keep and bear arms has been recognized as existing prior even to the creation of a written national constitution. The govermmnet should respect the 2nd amendment and the law in general. It's pity when some politicians think otherwise. People should understand that a gun is not a killing tool, it's self-defense tool. And we will stand for our right to keep and bear arms!"

They began siphoning out a rush of data after constructing what amounted to an electronic pipeline that led back to China, investigators told Congress last week in classified briefings. Much of the personnel data had been stored in the lightly protected systems of the Department of the Interior, because it had cheap, available space for digital data storage. The administration is urgently working to determine what other agencies are storing similarly sensitive information with weak protections. Officials would not identify their top concerns, but an audit issued early last year, before the Chinese attacks, harshly criticized lax security at the Internal Revenue Service, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Energy Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and the Department of Homeland Security, which has responsibility for securing the nation's critical networks. It's not clear who is held liable for security hole. What do you think the hacker attack will affect U.S. \u2014 Chinese relations?"

The war that is called the \"Civil War\" was actually the \"War for Southern Independence\". This is our history and our heritage. Just because certain groups have used the confederate flag in hate related crimes or racism does not make the southern flag racist.

Why should we give a citizenship to those who cannot give something good for the nation? The worst thing is that illegal immigrants who broke the law to live in the United States demand ask for indulgences. What nonsense! Illegals should be deported from the country invariably. But Obama's administration is tied to the chariot of immigrants. Democrats know that immigrants will vote for the Democratic party. Especially former illegals. That's why Barack Obama tries to give the Immigration Amnesty to illegals as soon as possible. It will allow to increase a number of votes for a Democratic Party presidential candidate in 2016. And democrats don't care about the fact that most of immigrants will become welfare recipients, increasing unemployment rate. America doesn't need immigrants, democrats do. What's more important: to win Presidential elections in 2016 or to make America better? Democrats seem to choose first option. That's what differs republicans from democrats."

Let's take a look at just how crazy this pledge gets. That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55 percent! But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to \"work to overturn any Supreme Court decision\" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge. Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws, creating loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious justification. That could actually happen \u2014 and it already has in some states \u2014 so it's a huge concern. And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated from their families, but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it! There's a part of me that feels very sad for NOM's fanatics. When they finally kick the bucket, they'll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly face it or not) that their Life's Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they worked for made anyone's life better. At all. They didn't win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable. And when they're dead and gone, they'll be remembered only as footnotes in shameful history \u2014 or more likely they'll be forgotten completely. #LGBT #NOM #SameSexMarriage #Marriage #SCOTUS #equality"

She is the ninth confirmed transgender homicide victim in the USA this year. Police in George County. Mississippi have charged a suspect Josh Brandon Vallum. Police said that Mercedes and Josh knew each other, but it is not clear if Vallum knew Williamson was a transgender. Jeanie Miller, whom Williamson had been living with, said that Vallum knew that Williamson was transgender. Modern America is too dangerous for transgenders. This is the ninth transgender killing based on gender identity. According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs' report hate-motivated violence against transgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a transgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in 1998 that allows discrimination against LGBT people. That also allows lawmakers to justify hostility toward transgender people. And that we call `freedom'? America is no longer land of freedom!"

'I spent the majority of my life lying, hiding and depressed because I felt like I couldn't truly be who I wanted to be and live freely as I saw fit. I had to act and that's not me. I, nor anyone else, should have to do that.' Matt decided to tell the truth publicly because of speculation that was going behind his back.

There are at least twenty eight percent of LGBT students in Asawa High School. It is the fact that we need such classes in every American school!

California Attorney General Kamala Harris claimed that the proposal was unconstitutional and it had no place in civil society. The proposal reminds me the Inquisition. We live in a free and tolerate country! So even talks about such an initiative should be immediately stopped. Where is our President? Stop considering gays as naughty and not like all the others.
