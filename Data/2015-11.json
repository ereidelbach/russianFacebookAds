The goal was to \"disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations.\" Well, the intervention deprived al-Qaida of a sanctuary. But al-Qaida \u2014 even after its leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos \u2014 has spawned cells elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question is whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the mission that hardly can be called successful? It seems that Obama should review his military strategy without delay.Join us! Veterans USA(  @veterans GovSpending"
