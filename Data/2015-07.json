The Boy Scouts of America Executive Committee unanimously approved allowing gay adults to serve as leaders, officials said on Monday, in a major step toward dismantling a policy that has caused deep rifts in the 105-year-old organization. This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders without regard to sexual orientation, continuing Scouting's longstanding policy of chartered organizations selecting their leaders. The Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay adults has stood as a towering example of explicit, institutional homophobia in one of America's most important and recognizable civic organizations. This is a step in the right direction, but we're still really concerned that there are still going to be groups that are going to be hostile to gay leaders ... This story certainly brought out the haters and the loony \"Christians.\" They've lost so many cultural battles in their effort to keep us all in the middle ages that I think it's unhinged most of them!"

        "text": "SOLDIER SHANE. Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service. Let's meet the big player in repealing the ban. Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary among his fellow Army soldiers. But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first openly trans soldier of the US Army. He's astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (check out his muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee, he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska. Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army paperwork, he is identified as a woman. But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded! America's military progressing slowly towards inclusion and equal opportunity. Let's hope that these changes'll ensure peace, instead of waging more war. #Igbt #transgender #equality #usarmy #Ortega"

After eight years on the job, Margie Winters was fired as director of religious education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she just married her wife, but because some parents just found out that she's been married for all eight years. Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is the biggest mistake! When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about being gay. And it's a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and harassment. Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It's very powerful both for straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs. It's important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation!"

Just wanted to see if you could share my coming out as trans story on your page. I have been on a long, rough journey to this point and I think my story could help younger trans youth see that no matter how bad it gets it always gets better. I would really appreciate this because I want to become someone who inspires the LGBT community to be themselves! Ever since I was little, I knew I was different. I wasn't like any of the other kids. I had a unique way of thinking and often that left me isolated. Something I still feel the sting of today. Unlike most boys who played with Spiderman and Superman action figures when they were little, I played with barbies ... I wanted to look like them. I wanted to be them. It felt right playing with these dolls. I had to hide when I did it though because even at an early age, I knew boys weren't supposed to play with dolls. Once I had gotten got caught by my grandmother's ex husband and he told me to put them away and stop being a sissy .... \" Please spend 5 minutes to read this letter ... it is very important just to be heart ... Thank you for your brave act! You are a true hero! Please share your stories and photos .... Inspire us and others!"

        "text": "Homophobic nurse tries to discourage birth mom from allowing gay couple to adopt child While the birth mother was resting with the baby, Andy and his partner took a break from the hospital to get some food. When they returned, they had a flurry of phone messages from the mother, crying and urging them to get back soon. A nurse had been questioning her about her decision to let a gay couple adopt her baby. \"Aren't you afraid those boys are gonna hurt that baby? Aren't you afraid that he's not gonna grow up and be normal?\" asked the nurse. Excuse me who the hell is she?! This bigot is forcing her views onto the mother, because she doesn't think the baby would grow up \"normal\"? A mother who's making the difficult decision to place her son up for adoption, and a wonderful couple who wants to raise that child. What the hell right does the nurse have to try to stop that? I hope they fire her. I'm happy for the Gay couple on becoming parents!"

        "text": "Made In The US: The Justice Turns Into Business For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor charges in New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'cause they couldn't afford to pay bail. Under the city's new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department, the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or disorderly conduct. The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what should we do? The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse, it is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a business. The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government will start to sell indulgences soon. Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail! Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other Presidents administrations were brought to justice. America has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a means to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping the very rich from ever being brought to justice."

He declared his shop a \"Muslim-free zone\" in response to a shooting in Chattanooga, where a Kuwait-born terrorist killed five US Marines. Hallinan announced his store's new policy sitting against the Confederate flag. The video posted in Facebook became popular. What we can say? Hallinan is completely right! If the government cannot provide our security, then we must do everything possible to provide it. A lot of Muslims become Islamists, who pose a real threat to our national security. We consider that it is really dangerous to sell arms to Muslims, as there're a lot of terrorists among them. The 2nd amendment was written for people, but it doesn't relieve people of responsibility."

The U.S. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida (21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421). Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps new terrorist attacks won't be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won't be tightened. We have a lot of problems that require an active response and decisions from the government: poverty, the problems of veterans, homelessness, racism, law enforcement system and so on. Is it possible to offer a better life for refugees if not all US citizens live normally?"

        "text": "The Census Bureau published the new data in its International Data Base, which contains population estimates and projections up to the year 2050. The figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration\u2014meaning the total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would actually be larger than 1.24 million. Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the U.S. economy. Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions increases crime rates. Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a report of the Center for Immigration Studies. You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen the U.S. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can't be the Tower of Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We don't hate foreigners, we are glad to see tourists from every corner of the world, but we cannot allow them to stay here. It's the bathos of stupidity to stimulate immigration when it creates enormous problems for the nation."

This statement sounds strange on the background of rapproachment between Obama's administration and Tehran. Although, this rapproachment in itself looks strange. We would remind you that Tehran has never expressed its condolences for the Iran hostage crisis. Moreover, the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Hosseini Khamenei is too disrespectful to the United States despite of friendly actions of Obama's administration. And Iranian military command claims that Iran is ready to come into collision with America at any moment. The Iran deal is a shame of the United States. Senate Republicans were right when they expressed their distrust of Iranian government. It's not clear why Obama has refused containment of Iran that is an potential enemy not only for the United States, but also for the rest world. Barack Obama is, by all appearances, a true traitor of the United States. And it's not empty words \u2014 the rapprochement with Iran is either a treachery or stupidness."

According to WSB-TV in Atlanta, the organization calls for the removal of all symbols of the Confederacy from the park, as well as any other state-owned buildings, parks and lands. The USA is out of balance now. We loose our history! The gays, lesbians and trans-sexuals have more rights now then other folks. They bring pervert culture in our houses as something normal. Today, LGBT community has turned into the head and everyone else is the tail. We inherit the history, we make it, and we are fated to become part of it. What kind of inheritage next generation will get? The rainbow flag that is offensive and a symbol of hate. Instead of delete a big part of our history, can we ban the rainbow from public display?"

        "text": "A terrorist attack was conducted at two U.S. military sites in Chattanooga Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez was shot and killed by police after he attacked two military sites in Chattanooga, Tennessee and killed four U.S. Marines at the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve Center. Authorities say a man was a practicing Muslim. At present FBI is conducting an investigation. According to his beliefs, Mohammad was a fundamental Islamist. Having examined after his death his social pages, FBI has found that he kept a blog and had a note where he said that he conducted a terrorist act in obedience to Allah. It is notable that the terrorist attack was conducted in the last day of Ramadan. It is noteworthy that in his letter the terrorist didn't refer to ISIS or AI-Qaeda; he acted in his own volition. We don't want to stir up Islamophobia, but if such manifestations of Islam have place, it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the Middle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to become radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on their own commit such attacks, the American society must take it more seriously. The society should develop a new behavioral model towards Islam, according to which, on the one hand Muslims and Christians will live comfortable together. And on the other hand, Muslims won't tend to radical activities and the destruction of peaceful life of Americans."

        "text": "The spread of hatred in the American society On Saturday there were two protests: a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina and an anti-racism protest. About 2,000 people arrived to South Carolina's statehouse. Some of them present the KKK's rally against the removal of the Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and Black Lives matter groups, holding the Republic of New Afrika flag. It is a very clear signal for the federal government that the protest obtains a systematic and ideological basis. The Klan wanted to underline the traditional heritage of the Confederate flag. Black protesters, on the contrary stand against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races. The main problem is hatred which is spread among our society. The government does nothing to solve the matter. If America is a land of free, we should clear our country of racism. But on the other hand we shouldn't refuse our history and our traditions."

President Obama hasn't ordered to lower a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or her state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By contrast, Obama ordered the flags to half-staff following on the same day that as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered to half-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon, the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of Nelson Mandela. But it hasn't yet been lowered in honor of the service members murdered in Tennessee. By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then decided to kill in the name of Allah. In general during the Obama presidency the country was divided in many ways: racism became more evident, the number of illegal immigrants, who do not even bother to learn English, because it's enough to speak Spanish, has increased."

Especially when you think about how much money is to be gained if same-sex couples are legally allowed to get married. A majority of small business owners believe companies shouldn't be allowed to withhold goods or services from lesbian, gay,bisexual or transgender people based on an owner's religious beliefs, according to a survey released Monday. Of course marriage is good for the business - no matter who it is that is marrying. It's a billion dollar industry in our country! I am certain that if a state supported marriage for all, then business would flourish. No one would be offended by not being considered legitimate, when their feelings are legitimate."

He has been discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky. There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to change the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery. But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats. It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\\her identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they were assigned to at birth. Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible. Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you were assigned to at birth. Please share your stories with us, because united we can stand against injustice and inequality! #Kentucky #transgender #inequality #discrimination"

The outrage was caused by artist's artwork recreating iconic Iwo Jima photo. with a gay pride flag and half-naked men has received death threats. That's a bit too harsh treatment for an artist, don't you think? What's this; the American version of Je suis Charlie? Joe Rosenthal's picture of soldiers hauling a flag pole up after declaring the island of Iwo Jima secure during the Second World War won the Pulitzer Prize in 1945. Around 70.000 U.S. troops fought more than 20,000 Japanese. It wasn't a fair fight back then, and it's not a fair fight today. But there's nothing disrespectful in this image. Isn't the imitation is the best form of homage? #homophobia #JoeRosenthal #EdFreeman #IwoJlma"

Mike Lee has been anti-LGBT conservatives' top priority since the Supreme Court brought marriage equality to all 50 states. It's part of the National Organization for Marriage's post-Obergefell plan and Republican presidential candidate pledge, and the Family Research Council mentions it almost daily. Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does is enable anti-gay discrimination. Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against religious institutions \u2014for discriminating against people in same-sex marriages. It's the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex couple's marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them. Mr. Lee, you are ridiculous! You're just going to have to get over that fact that we have full Federal civil rights now. Or don't! We will go on happily living our lives while you froth at the mouth and throw a fit because we're being treated equally under the law!"

Wedding cake is back in the news with developments in both the Oregon and Colorado bakery cases involving discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In Oregon, judgment has been finalized against Sweet Cakes by Melissa, requiring Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay a $135,000 fine for refusing service to a same-sex couple. Meanwhile, in Colorado, Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop, is appealing the ruling against him for refusing to serve a same-sex couple. In the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, conservatives are eager to highlight Phillips and the Kleins as evidence that religious freedom is under attack. In fact, they have actually invented a new claim about how these bakers' \"free speech\" is under attack and how they're thus the real victims. There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do business with the public! This is not a free speech issue, it is an issue of American law! They can speak about their bigotry and ignorance, not to practice it!"

The show, which has already won praise for including a number of strong, female characters in a comparatively male-dominated genre, has now hinted at further diversity. That's s000 nice!

For decades, conservative Christians who oppose LGBT equality have singled out the federal government or secular atheists as their preferred enemy in public settings, blasting both groups for supposedly attacking \"traditional marriage\" or infringing on their religious liberty. Yet in the months surrounding the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to legalize same-sex marriage across the country, right-wing Christians have become increasingly willing to cast blame \u2014 seemingly hypocritically \u2014 on a group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians, especially those who support marriage equality. I believe religions should teach love, they must stop teaching hatred! And noticed while progressive Christians are constantly under attack from conservative Christians, they're not the ones screaming \"persecution\". They are just tired of the persecution."

She spoke about her own personal experience so far as a transgender woman. But she also dedicated a significant percentage of her speech to a thoughtful and touching discussion of the vast number of issues facing the larger transgender community. In her past life Caitlyn was known worldwide as a sports hero. Today she is an American hero of a great courage. Because it takes courage to stand up and do everything she has done and is doing. #CaitlynJenner #transgender #equality #ESPY"

        "text": "Controversy surrounding the flag only heats animosity among Americans. And it is becoming dangerous. So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family. \"He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn't worth anything now,\" Mark Wilson said. When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it's amoral, it is beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don't want to understand that slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a flag of England or France. Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political correctness because George Washington owned slaves. Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not clear. If somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to eliminate the party. Continue to stay for the First amendment! Let's stop the chaos!"
