        "text": "Fellow Texans! It's time to say a strong NO to the establishment robbers. It is unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no. We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE! Use our page to team up with other locals. Invite your friends and family, spread the word and let's make this effort together! Get Ready to Secede!"

However, most of these athletes paid the price for this demonstration. For instance, on September 10, after getting permission from league officials, the staff and the students of the Beaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. On the next day, the students and the staff received death threats. Moreover, the executive board decided to suspend Coach RahORah Barber for the rest of the season and canceled the whole football season. So now we know what opposition might face in this country."

And here are some real Clinton decisions: \u2014Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had been exaggerated by Republicans. \u2014In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007 supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans' medical care. -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20 million for veterans' health care facilities. -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.\" In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad! Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!"

        "text": "Boston police shot and killed a man wearing body armor and wielding an assault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William Evans. A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33, of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October 12.H e was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire themselves. This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against cops, will become the President of the United States. Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country. Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse racism, against those who want to destroy America! Among all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend the police from terrorists."

        "text": "VIDEO: TEXAS SCHOOL TEACHER FIRED AFTER MANHANDLING LITTLE BLACK BOY The shocking video shows a Central Texas child trying to get up from a bean bag chair in his classroom, while a Snook Independent School District employee, Troy Vann pushing him repeatedly into it and mocking him again and again. After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher manhandling a small child on Facebook, the video went viral and it was shared thousands of times. In the video footage, Vann also tells the boy: \"Tell me no. When I tell you to do something, you do it, boy.\" After the Burleson County Sheriff's Office launched an investigation, a \"behavior specialist\" who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young student was fired. The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who abuse any child. The teachers who use excessive force against any child should be removed immediately from the classroom and placed on administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen."

        "text": "On October 15, 1966, Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton have founded BPP. Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change, we must take action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party \"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country\". They tried to close it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was dissolved. 50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that can make Black Lives really matter. Let's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has made the change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their ideas and ideals! Black Panther Party 50th Anniversary"

October 22nd is a day that people around the nation have mobilized every year since 1996 for a National Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a Generation. Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims and quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well- known case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man, who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot. We need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and serve! Not to kill, damage and cripple! Join us on October 22, in Charlotte, 600 East Trade Street, just between Charlotte City hall and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. National Day of Protest. Charlotte, NC"

The man was arrested right in the Capitol and charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief. It is not clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale. Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how liberal propaganda influences even on Southern people. The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people's respect. It is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names! We should protect our history and fight against liberal brainwashing."

        "text": "HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANS The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are some real Clinton decisions: \u2014Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had been exaggerated by Republicans. \u2014In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007 supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans' medical care. -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20 million for veterans' health care facilities. -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.\" In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad! Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!"
